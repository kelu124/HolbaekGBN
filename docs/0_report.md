Based on the search results, there is **highly relevant information** about both architectural history and green building standards specific to Holbæk.

## Architectural Heritage

Holbæk has significant architectural heritage centered around the **Better Building Practices movement** (Bedre Byggeskik). The area of Bakkekammen is recognized as the **birthplace of this architectural style**, which was a forerunner of Danish modernism [^1]. The merchant's house at Bakkekammen 40, designed by architect Ivar Bentsen and built in 1917, stands as one of Denmark's best preserved examples of this movement [^1]. This architectural philosophy, established in 1915, sought to build simple, sensible properties with high standards and a good balance between layout, materials, and aesthetics [^1].

The city also features extensive historical building stock, including **half-timbered buildings from the 17th to 19th centuries** that comprise Holbæk Museum [^2]. These include the Søren May House from around 1670, the old Town Hall from 1844 designed by F.F. Friis in late-empire style, and various merchant houses [^3] [^2].

## Green Building Standards and Implementation

Holbæk has been actively implementing ambitious green building standards through specific projects. The **Holbæk kindergarten project** achieved **DGNB Gold certification**, emphasizing life cycle assessment, resource efficiency, and social, economic, and ecological quality [^4]. This project featured innovative sustainable design elements including salt-impregnated wood facades that eliminate toxic treatments, large canopies for passive solar control, and prioritization of natural, long-lasting materials like wood and linoleum indoors [^4].

The municipality used the **BVB database** to verify that all construction materials met health and environmental criteria, with a color-coded classification system (green for recommended, yellow for accepted, red for avoided materials) [^4]. This verification process was integrated into the DGNB certification requirements.

Additionally, Holbæk Kommune is a partner in the **Future Baltic Bauhaus project**, which emphasizes circularity and CO2-reduction in construction through material reuse and "second life" approaches within the built environment [^5]. This project aims to develop guidelines and training programs for circular building practices.

## Integration Opportunities

For city planners, Holbæk presents a unique opportunity to **balance heritage preservation with cutting-edge sustainability standards**. The city's historical Better Building Practices movement—which emphasized simplicity, quality craftsmanship, and appropriate materials—shares philosophical alignment with contemporary green building principles of resource efficiency and material consciousness.
