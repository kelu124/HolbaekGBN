| The project focuses on promoting physical, mental, and social well-being in the built environment, addressing the needs of vulnerable groups, including children. By integrating health considerations into urban planning, Holbaek aims to create environments that support the health and well-being of its residents, making this a central theme.                                                                     | Well-being      | Health and care in the community               |
| The emphasis on co-creation and community involvement highlights the importance of fostering social inclusion and interaction among various groups. By creating citizen-driven initiatives that bridge differences, Holbaek aims to build strong social bonds, particularly for vulnerable families and children.                                                                                                         | Social cohesion | Living together, interdependence and mutuality |

**Holbaek has been directly involved in projects focused on promoting well-being and better conditions for vulnerable groups, including children, through urban planning and co-creation initiatives.** The most relevant and specific information comes from the interdisciplinary project "The Urban Health Culture of the Future," in which Holbaek Municipality was a project partner [^1].

Key points specific to Holbaek:

- **Holbaek Municipality participated as a project partner** in "The Urban Health Culture of the Future," an initiative supported by Realdania and Juul Frost Architects, aimed at integrating health and well-being into urban planning [^1]. This project developed tools and strategies to promote *physical, mental, and social well-being* in the built environment, with a focus on inclusivity for all social groups, including vulnerable children.

- The project emphasizes a **holistic approach** to well-being, addressing social, physical, and mental needs. It advocates for urban spaces and green areas that are developed with a demographic approach, considering the diverse needs of different age groups, including children, and ensuring coherence between the physical environment and residents' needs [^1].

- **Co-creation and community involvement** are highlighted as essential strategies. The project recommends creating citizen-driven initiatives, such as cultural centers and spaces where volunteers act as hosts to foster social inclusion and bridge-building between different groups. This approach is intended to help vulnerable children and families feel included and supported in the community [^1].

- The project also stresses the importance of **social architecture**—not just building physical spaces, but also facilitating ongoing social initiatives and community-building activities after the completion of physical projects. This includes supporting local sports clubs, leisure activities, and resident-driven communities that can empower vulnerable groups and promote social cohesion [^1].

- The tools and strategies developed in this project are designed to be *applicable and feasible* in municipalities like Holbaek, which are described as economically advantaged and generally integrated cities [^1].

In summary, **Holbaek has been actively involved in developing and applying innovative, inclusive urban planning strategies to improve conditions for vulnerable groups, especially children, through holistic well-being initiatives and community co-creation** [^1].
