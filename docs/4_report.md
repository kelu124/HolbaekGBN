| One of the key projects mentioned focuses on protecting biodiversity through significant initiatives such as the planting of diverse tree species. This demonstrates an active response to ecological needs and showcases a commitment towards preserving and improving ecosystem services within the local community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Preservation and improvement of environment | Biodiversity and ecosystem services            |
| The collaborative approach to biodiversity management, where citizens are entrust with specific tasks and responsibilities, exemplifies good governance practices that empower residents. This participatory model ensures community engagement in environmental stewardship and decision-making, fundamental for sustainable development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Preservation and improvement of environment | Governance, empowerment and engagement         |
| The municipality's use of a mosaic governance approach promotes community engagement by involving green volunteers in managing local commons and biodiversity projects. This collaborative model fosters social bonds and mutual responsibility among residents, highlighting the importance of community involvement in sustainable practices. Such initiatives strengthen community identity and encourage cooperation, contributing to social cohesion.                                                                                                               | Social cohesion                             | Living together, interdependence and mutuality |
| The focus on creating recreational areas and parks as part of broader urban biodiversity efforts enhances the attractiveness of Holbæk Municipality. These initiatives not only provide environmental benefits but also enrich cultural experiences and community identity, making the area more appealing for residents and visitors alike.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Attractiveness                              | Culture and community identity                 |

Based on the available information, Holbæk Municipality has been actively involved in several biodiversity initiatives, though specific details are limited.

## Recent Forest Restoration Project

Holbæk Municipality is home to a significant biodiversity project on the island of Orø in the Isefjord. EcoTree launched a sustainable forest project in April 2024, transforming 9.9 hectares of depleted agricultural land into the Orø-Margrete Forest [^1]. This initiative involves planting more than 40,000 trees of 10 different species, including Winter Oak, Common Beech, Hornbeam, and Larch, designed to enhance local biodiversity and forest resilience to climate change [^1]. The area includes special groundwater interests and coastal proximity zones, with 3.3 hectares dedicated to forest edges to improve the forest climate and biological value [^1].

## Community-Based Green Initiatives

Holbæk Municipality has embraced a **mosaic governance** approach to biodiversity management, entrusting green volunteers with managing cattle on municipal commons and facilitating volunteer-led green initiatives [^2]. This demonstrates a collaborative model where the municipality works alongside citizens to maintain and enhance natural areas.

## Broader Context

The municipality's work on recreational areas with urban nature and parks has been documented as part of Denmark's broader urban biodiversity efforts [^3]. These initiatives align with Denmark's national movement toward nature restoration, including the ambitious Tripartite Agreement goal to restore 140,000 hectares of low-lying farmland into natural areas like meadows and wetlands [^4].
