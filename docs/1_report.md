Based on the search results, Holbæk has several significant examples of preserved architectural and cultural environments that offer valuable insights for city planning:

## Historical Building Preservation

Holbæk Museum represents one of Denmark's most remarkable preservation successes, comprising a complex of **12-13 historic buildings** from the 17th to 19th centuries, with 11 buildings standing in their **original locations** dating back to as early as 1660 [^1] [^2]. This preservation approach maintains authentic historical environments while serving as a functional cultural institution, demonstrating how historic sites can remain integrated into contemporary urban life.

The **Merchant House** foundation consists of large granite ashlars believed to be the last preserved remains of Holbæk's old parish church, showing how architectural elements can be repurposed while maintaining historical significance [^2].

## Better Building Practices Movement

**Bakkekammen 40** stands as one of Denmark's best preserved examples of Better Building Practices architecture, designed by architect Ivar Bentsen and built in 1917 [^3]. This property remained in the same family for over 100 years until acquisition by Realdania By & Byg, with its doors, flagstones, cupboards, paintwork and layout authentically preserved [^3]. The Better Building Practices philosophy emphasized building simple, sensible properties with high standards and good balance between layout, materials and aesthetics—principles highly relevant for contemporary sustainable urban development [^3].

The surrounding Bakkekammen neighborhood largely consists of houses designed by Ivar Bentsen and colleague Marius Pedersen, creating a cohesive architectural district that demonstrates successful area-wide preservation [^3].

## Balancing Old and New

Holbæk demonstrates deliberate attempts to **design new construction in sympathy with historic buildings** [^4]. Modern harbourside apartment areas have been developed alongside beautifully preserved and colorful structures from Holbæk's past as a merchant hub, showing that preservation doesn't require freezing development but rather thoughtful integration [^4].

## Active Cultural Use

The converted power station **Musikhus Elværket** exemplifies adaptive reuse, functioning as a concert venue for modern music while maintaining its industrial heritage [^5]. Similarly, Bogart transformed from a 40-year-old traditional antiquarian shop into a book café and intimate performance space in 2021 [^5].

These examples demonstrate that preservation in Holbæk succeeds by maintaining **authentic historical environments** while ensuring buildings remain functionally relevant to contemporary community needs.
