| The project aims to establish a modern, energy-efficient district heating network that will enhance the local economy by promoting sustainable energy practices. This initiative addresses the attractiveness of Holbaek as it transforms the energy landscape, making it more appealing to potential residents and businesses. The collaboration with the industrial sector for surplus heat also adds economic diversity, making the area more economically vibrant. | Attractiveness                              | Economy and sustainable production and consumption |
| The integration of geothermal energy and the sourcing of surplus heat from industrial processes contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, thus enhancing the environmental performance of the community. Holbaek's efforts to shift from gas heating to renewable sources actively supports biodiversity by mitigating climate change impacts, thereby preserving local ecosystems.                                                                    | Preservation and improvement of environment | Biodiversity and ecosystem services                |
| The phased implementation of the district heating project emphasizes the community's ability to adapt to energy challenges, thereby enhancing its resilience. Additionally, providing more efficient heating solutions supports the health and well-being of residents by improving living conditions, thereby fostering a healthier community environment.                                                                                                            | Resilience                                  | Health and care in the community                   |
| The project promotes the responsible use of resources by transitioning to geothermal heating and utilizing industrial surplus heat, which represents efficient utilization of existing resources. By encouraging sustainable energy practices, it sets a precedent for responsible resource management within the community.                                                                                                                                           | Responsible resource use                    | Living and working environment                     |
| The necessity for a 70% sign-up rate from heat consumers emphasizes community engagement and fosters social cohesion. The governance model encourages inclusive decision-making, ensuring that residents are actively involved in the transition, which promotes a stronger sense of community and mutual support.                                                                                                                                                     | Social cohesion                             | Governance, empowerment and engagement             |
| The project is set to improve living conditions through access to efficient heating solutions. This contributes to the overall well-being of residents by enhancing comfort and safety within homes, which is crucial for quality of life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Well-being                                  | Living and working environment                     |
| The transition to geothermal district heating represents a key initiative in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and optimizing resource use. By replacing oil and gas with sustainable energy sources, the project directly contributes to the environment's preservation and promotes responsible production and consumption patterns within the community.                                                                                                            | Preservation and improvement of environment | Economy and sustainable production and consumption |

Holbaek has embarked on one of Denmark's most ambitious district heating transitions, with several unique features specific to its context:

## The Green Transition Challenge

Holbaek holds the distinction of being **Denmark's largest gas-heated city**, with approximately 30,000 inhabitants and 64% of heating currently based on oil or natural gas [^1] [^2]. This makes the district heating rollout both crucial and exceptionally challenging compared to other Danish municipalities. The Municipal Council approved phase 1 in March 2024, with the first heat customers expected to have district heating by the end of 2025, and the complete rollout finishing by the end of 2028 [^3].

## Phased Implementation Strategy

The rollout follows a six-phase approach spanning nearly a decade. Phase 1 (2025-2028) targets large heat consumers including housing associations, municipal institutions, and the hospital [^3]. A critical requirement for moving forward is achieving **70% sign-up rate** from heat consumers, making community engagement essential for the project's success [^3]. Subsequent phases extend through 2034, with areas like Svinninge and Tølløse still under consideration [^3].

## Geothermal Energy Integration

What makes Holbaek particularly special is its modern, energy-efficient district heating network designed to operate at approximately 80°C in winter [^2]. This temperature range is perfectly suited for geothermal heating, as the expected geothermal water temperature falls between 60-80°C, requiring minimal power for heating pumps [^1] [^2]. Utility company Fors has partnered with geothermal developer Innargi to provide **two well pairs supplying 15-30 MW**, with delivery anticipated toward the end of 2026 [^1] [^2].

## Industrial Surplus Heat Potential

Holbaek has access to significant surplus heat from industrial production in neighboring Kalundborg. A district cooling system investment of €1.4 billion could generate enough surplus heat to potentially replace natural gas entirely in Holbaek [^4]. This cross-municipal collaboration represents an innovative approach to leveraging industrial waste heat for residential heating needs.

## Local Governance Model

The project is driven by the municipally-owned utility Fors A/S, following Denmark's non-profit district heating principle where municipalities deliver approximately two-thirds of all district heating [^5]. This governance structure ensures community-oriented decision-making while navigating the complex coordination required between citizens, institutions, and infrastructure development [^3].
