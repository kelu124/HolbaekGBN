Based on the search results, there is no specific project called the "Holbaek Station and Cityhall Project" mentioned. However, I can identify relevant initiatives involving Holbæk Station that are pertinent to city planning:

## The Connected Journey Mobility Project

Holbæk Station is central to "The Connected Journey" mobility project, which aims to develop mobility offers and a mobility hub adapted for potential users in Region Zealand [^1]. The project focuses on creating attractive nodes to offer a coherent and easy journey experience for passengers using public transport, with the goal of encouraging a mode shift from private cars to public transport [^1].

**Key aspects relevant to city planning:**

The target group includes commuters who work or study close to the transport hub but lack an attractive transport and service offering, leading them to choose private cars for their entire journey [^1]. The project involves collaboration between Region Zealand (project owner), Gate 21 (project management), Movia, and Holbæk Municipality [^1].

Holbæk Municipality has incorporated nodes and shared mobility into its new mobility plan as a separate area of action, with cycling initiatives for employees at Holbæk Townhall mentioned as one initiative [^1]. A vision plan for future transformation of the station was adopted in January 2024 [^1].

The station's strategic location places it within walking distance of key destinations: Holbæk Hospital (approximately 1 km), educational institutions (approximately 1-2.5 km away), the nearest supermarket (600 meters), and Ahlgade shopping area (400 meters) [^1].

Regarding infrastructure specifically connecting the station and town hall, the search results indicate that Holbæk Townhall is among the mapped destinations near the station [^1], but no dedicated joint project between these two facilities is mentioned.
