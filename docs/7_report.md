The Fjordstien (Cycle Route 40) is a 275-kilometer cycling and hiking route that directly connects to Holbæk and represents a significant infrastructure asset for the city [^1]. This long-distance path circumnavigates both the Isefjord and Roskilde Fjord, with Holbæk positioned as a key waypoint along the route [^2].

## Fjordstien's Role in Holbæk's Infrastructure

The route passes through Holbæk as part of a multi-day cycling journey, with the city serving as an overnight stop on day 3 of the typical five-day circuit that starts and ends in Roskilde [^2]. The path follows the western shoreline of the Isefjord when approaching and departing Holbæk, providing cyclists with views of the fjord as a constant companion [^2].

**Direct access** to the Fjordstien is available from the Outdoor Gateway Holbæk Fjord, a facility located at Holbæk Fjord Camping and Wellness Centre at the edge of the city [^1]. This gateway serves as a central node for outdoor activities and provides rental bicycles that can be dropped off at ten different locations in Odsherred, facilitating one-way cycling trips along the route [^1].

## Infrastructure Connections

From Holbæk, the Fjordstien continues southward around Tempelkrogen, a narrow inlet known for its birdlife and tranquility, winding through quiet farmland and low-lying wetlands [^2]. The route connects to other long-distance paths including Fjernvandrevej E6 and Gudernes Stræde, making Holbæk a junction point for multiple recreational infrastructure corridors [^1].

The city's position on this established cycling network, combined with facilities like the Outdoor Gateway offering guided tours and bike rentals, creates opportunities for Holbæk to leverage the Fjordstien as both a recreational amenity for residents and a tourism draw that brings cyclists into the city center.
