The **Jyderup Bymidte Project strategy for city centre** is a targeted initiative within Holbæk Municipality focused on revitalizing Jyderup’s town centre through a combination of urban, social, and economic measures specific to the local context [^1] [^2] [^3].

Key elements specific to Holbæk and Jyderup include:

- **Integration of Nature and Urban Life:** The strategy builds on Jyderup’s vision to become an *active town in nature*, leveraging its proximity to forests, Naturpark Åmosen, and Skarresø. Plans include establishing green corridors to strengthen the connection between the town centre and surrounding nature, making Jyderup a destination for both nature and culture [^1].

- **Public-Private Collaboration:** The project emphasizes cooperation between local actors, businesses, associations, and Holbæk Municipality to ensure a holistic approach to development. This collaboration is seen as essential for realizing the vision and implementing concrete improvements in the town centre [^1] [^3].

- **Infrastructure Adaptation:** Upcoming changes, such as the removal of motorway ramps due to the extension of Kalundborgmotorvejen, will increase traffic on Skarridsøgade. The strategy addresses the need to rethink physical spaces in the centre to improve mobility, access, and the overall experience for residents and visitors [^1].

- **Revitalizing Retail and Commerce:** Jyderup’s retail sector, concentrated around Skarridsøgade, has seen an 11% decline in shops over five years. The strategy aims to counteract this trend by fostering closer cooperation among businesses, associations, and citizens, creating a more attractive and vibrant town centre to support local economic growth [^1].

- **Placemaking and Community Spaces:** There is a strong focus on transforming the central station square into a greener, more welcoming, and multifunctional space for all age groups. The aim is to create a “heart of the town” that encourages community, culture, and business activities, with features for recreation, play, and biodiversity [^2].

- **Funding and Implementation:** Holbæk Municipality has allocated funds for the development of public spaces in Jyderup, supporting the strategy’s goals of a green and sustainable town centre. Specific projects include the demolition and replacement of outdated buildings to improve the urban environment [^2].

- **Strategic Process:** In spring 2025, Holbæk Kommune initiated a project to develop a comprehensive strategy for Jyderup’s town centre, with the goal of strengthening local identity, community, and economic resilience [^3].

These elements are directly tied to the context of Holbæk and Jyderup, reflecting local priorities, challenges, and opportunities as outlined in municipal plans and ongoing community projects [^1] [^2] [^3].
