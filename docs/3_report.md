Holbæk Municipality has committed to becoming **CO2 neutral by 2050** through its climate strategy "Holbæk 2050," which was approved in October 2022 and aligns with the DK2020 project requirements for Paris Agreement compatibility [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4]. 

Key details specific to Holbæk include:
- **Ambitious Targets:** Holbæk aims for a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 compared to 1990, and full climate neutrality by 2050 [^1] [^2] [^5].
- **Scenario Analyses:** The municipality developed three scenarios to assess the impact of various climate actions, including scope 3 emissions (from goods and services produced within Holbæk) and agricultural emissions [^1].
- **Energy Transition:** Holbæk is transitioning its heat supply from natural gas to renewables, focusing on district heating, wood chip boilers, heat pumps, and solar heat. Biogas production is also being expanded, with a potential of 100 GWh per year [^2].
- **Green Electricity:** Over 30% of Holbæk’s electricity already comes from local renewables, mainly wind turbines. The municipality is exploring further expansion of wind and solar power, considering impacts on local communities and nature [^2].
- **Sustainable Transport:** Transport accounts for about 30% of Holbæk’s emissions. The municipality is promoting electric vehicles by expanding charging infrastructure and encouraging cycling through improved paths and electric bicycle initiatives [^2].
- **Collaborative Approach:** Holbæk’s strategy involves partnerships with citizens, companies, and other municipalities, and it participates in peer learning with cities like Oslo to advance its climate goals [^4].
- **Strategic Planning:** The climate strategy includes both short-term and long-term frameworks, such as the Climate Adaptation Plan (2014) and the Strategic Energy Plan (2020), which guide ongoing sustainability actions [^2] [^6].

These measures are designed to ensure Holbæk meets its **2050 CO2 neutrality goal** while also contributing to Denmark’s national climate targets and the broader European climate agenda [^1] [^3] [^4] [^5].
