Based on the search results, I can provide you with specific information about the Fjordbyen development project in Holbæk, though it appears the scale may be different from the "5000 housings" you mentioned.

## The Fjordbyen Development Project

Gefion Group is leading an ambitious urban development project called Fjordbyen (Fjord City) by Holbæk Fjord, which represents a completely new and green district for the city [^1]. The Holbæk municipality's economic committee unanimously decided to initiate the local planning process for this development [^1].

## Scale and Scope

The overall local plan encompasses approximately **300,000 square meters of housing**, with Gefion Group's share expected to cover approximately 250,000 square meters of construction [^1]. This represents a significant urban expansion for Holbæk, though the exact number of housing units is not specified in the available information.

## Integrated Urban Functions

The development goes beyond just residential construction and includes a comprehensive range of urban amenities [^1]:

- Schools and educational institutions
- Various public institutions
- A train station
- Grocery stores and retail services

This approach aligns with modern urban planning principles that emphasize creating complete, walkable neighborhoods rather than purely residential zones.

## Current Development Progress

There is already visible progress in Holbæk's urban development, particularly at the Jernstøberigrunden (former iron foundry site) [^2]. Two high-rise buildings have been erected as part of stage 1 development, featuring large glazing units that provide natural light and views of green communal areas, the city center, and harbor [^2]. This project reflects Holbæk municipality's vision of urban formation and densification as a contribution to creating a more dynamic and sustainable district [^2].
