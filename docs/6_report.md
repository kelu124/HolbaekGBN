The **Tølløse Streetzone** is a community-driven urban development project in Tølløse, a railway town of approximately 4,007 residents located in Holbæk Municipality in northwestern Zealand [^1]. This project directly addresses the needs of local youth and promotes active community engagement in an area where traditional recreational options have been limited.

## Project Background and Motivation

Tølløse has a substantial young population, with 662 children aged 6-16 residing in the town, plus an additional 700 youth attending the local folkeskole, two private schools, three efterskole (continuation schools), and a specialized school [^2]. Despite this significant demographic, young people in Tølløse have faced limited options for leisure activities beyond traditional organized sports that typically occur in the afternoon hours [^2].

The project emerged from concerns about youth wellbeing that mirror broader national trends—specifically, the tendency for children and young people to experience isolation and excessive screen time [^2]. Local volunteers recognized the urgent need for a physical gathering space where youth could engage in unstructured, active recreation.

## Project Components and Objectives

The Tølløse Streetzone aims to create facilities and spaces that encourage children, young people, and older residents to participate in diverse physical activities beyond organized sports [^2]. The project is strategically located adjacent to the town's existing hall, making it accessible and integrated into the community's infrastructure [^2].

A central component of the streetzone is a **skatepark**, for which the organizing group Tølløse Skaterpark Støtteforening received **200,000 kr in funding** from LAG Nordvestsjælland (Local Action Group Northwest Zealand) [^2]. This skatepark represents one element of the broader streetzone concept, which is designed to serve as both an activity space and a social gathering point where young people are explicitly welcomed to meet and congregate [^2].

## Relevance to Holbæk's Urban Planning Context

This project aligns with Holbæk Municipality's broader commitment to sustainable community development and climate-conscious urban planning. The municipality has set ambitious targets, including a 70% CO2 reduction by 2030 [^3] [^4], and emphasizes creating livable spaces for all residents across its 18 local areas covering 578.33 km² [^3].

The streetzone exemplifies the kind of grassroots, community-focused initiative that complements municipal-level strategic planning, addressing social wellbeing and physical activity—both recognized priorities in contemporary Nordic urban development approaches.
