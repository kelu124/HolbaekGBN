While acceptable for most cache scenarios, a motivated attacker can craft two different payloads that map to the same cache key. If that risk matters in your environment, supply a stronger encoder (e.g. SHA-256 or BLAKE2) via the `key_encoder` argument. If you change the key encoder, consider also creating a new cache, to avoid (the potential for) collisions with existing keys.\n",
