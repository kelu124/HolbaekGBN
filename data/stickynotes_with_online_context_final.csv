Planning for architectural history and green standards,"Based on the search results, there is **highly relevant information** about both architectural history and green building standards specific to Holbæk.

## Architectural Heritage

Holbæk has significant architectural heritage centered around the **Better Building Practices movement** (Bedre Byggeskik). The area of Bakkekammen is recognized as the **birthplace of this architectural style**, which was a forerunner of Danish modernism[[https://www.realdaniabyogbyg.org/projects/bakkekammen-40]]. The merchant's house at Bakkekammen 40, designed by architect Ivar Bentsen and built in 1917, stands as one of Denmark's best preserved examples of this movement[[https://www.realdaniabyogbyg.org/projects/bakkekammen-40]]. This architectural philosophy, established in 1915, sought to build simple, sensible properties with high standards and a good balance between layout, materials, and aesthetics[[https://www.realdaniabyogbyg.org/projects/bakkekammen-40]].

The city also features extensive historical building stock, including **half-timbered buildings from the 17th to 19th centuries** that comprise Holbæk Museum[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holb%C3%A6k_Museum]]. These include the Søren May House from around 1670, the old Town Hall from 1844 designed by F.F. Friis in late-empire style, and various merchant houses[[https://vestmuseum.dk/en/holbaek-museum/faste-udstillinger/]][[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holb%C3%A6k_Museum]].

## Green Building Standards and Implementation

Holbæk has been actively implementing ambitious green building standards through specific projects. The **Holbæk kindergarten project** achieved **DGNB Gold certification**, emphasizing life cycle assessment, resource efficiency, and social, economic, and ecological quality[[https://interreg-baltic.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NHC3-practical-guide-for-municipal-buildings.pdf]]. This project featured innovative sustainable design elements including salt-impregnated wood facades that eliminate toxic treatments, large canopies for passive solar control, and prioritization of natural, long-lasting materials like wood and linoleum indoors[[https://interreg-baltic.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NHC3-practical-guide-for-municipal-buildings.pdf]].

The municipality used the **BVB database** to verify that all construction materials met health and environmental criteria, with a color-coded classification system (green for recommended, yellow for accepted, red for avoided materials)[[https://interreg-baltic.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NHC3-practical-guide-for-municipal-buildings.pdf]]. This verification process was integrated into the DGNB certification requirements.

Additionally, Holbæk Kommune is a partner in the **Future Baltic Bauhaus project**, which emphasizes circularity and CO2-reduction in construction through material reuse and ""second life"" approaches within the built environment[[https://fbb.holbaek.dk/the-project]]. This project aims to develop guidelines and training programs for circular building practices.

## Integration Opportunities

For city planners, Holbæk presents a unique opportunity to **balance heritage preservation with cutting-edge sustainability standards**. The city's historical Better Building Practices movement—which emphasized simplicity, quality craftsmanship, and appropriate materials—shares philosophical alignment with contemporary green building principles of resource efficiency and material consciousness.",Hoelbaek
Preservation of architectural and cultural environment,"Based on the search results, Holbæk has several significant examples of preserved architectural and cultural environments that offer valuable insights for city planning:

## Historical Building Preservation

Holbæk Museum represents one of Denmark's most remarkable preservation successes, comprising a complex of **12-13 historic buildings** from the 17th to 19th centuries, with 11 buildings standing in their **original locations** dating back to as early as 1660[[https://vestmuseum.dk/en/grupper/rundvisninger/introduktion-til-holbaek-museum/]][[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holb%C3%A6k_Museum]]. This preservation approach maintains authentic historical environments while serving as a functional cultural institution, demonstrating how historic sites can remain integrated into contemporary urban life.

The **Merchant House** foundation consists of large granite ashlars believed to be the last preserved remains of Holbæk's old parish church, showing how architectural elements can be repurposed while maintaining historical significance[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holb%C3%A6k_Museum]].

## Better Building Practices Movement

**Bakkekammen 40** stands as one of Denmark's best preserved examples of Better Building Practices architecture, designed by architect Ivar Bentsen and built in 1917[[https://www.realdaniabyogbyg.org/projects/bakkekammen-40]]. This property remained in the same family for over 100 years until acquisition by Realdania By & Byg, with its doors, flagstones, cupboards, paintwork and layout authentically preserved[[https://www.realdaniabyogbyg.org/projects/bakkekammen-40]]. The Better Building Practices philosophy emphasized building simple, sensible properties with high standards and good balance between layout, materials and aesthetics—principles highly relevant for contemporary sustainable urban development[[https://www.realdaniabyogbyg.org/projects/bakkekammen-40]].

The surrounding Bakkekammen neighborhood largely consists of houses designed by Ivar Bentsen and colleague Marius Pedersen, creating a cohesive architectural district that demonstrates successful area-wide preservation[[https://www.realdaniabyogbyg.org/projects/bakkekammen-40]].

## Balancing Old and New

Holbæk demonstrates deliberate attempts to **design new construction in sympathy with historic buildings**[[https://memorablereviews.wordpress.com/2022/12/07/holbaek-is-a-must-see-danish-destination/]]. Modern harbourside apartment areas have been developed alongside beautifully preserved and colorful structures from Holbæk's past as a merchant hub, showing that preservation doesn't require freezing development but rather thoughtful integration[[https://memorablereviews.wordpress.com/2022/12/07/holbaek-is-a-must-see-danish-destination/]].

## Active Cultural Use

The converted power station **Musikhus Elværket** exemplifies adaptive reuse, functioning as a concert venue for modern music while maintaining its industrial heritage[[https://travel.nears.me/countries/denmark/holbk-travel-guide/]]. Similarly, Bogart transformed from a 40-year-old traditional antiquarian shop into a book café and intimate performance space in 2021[[https://travel.nears.me/countries/denmark/holbk-travel-guide/]].

These examples demonstrate that preservation in Holbæk succeeds by maintaining **authentic historical environments** while ensuring buildings remain functionally relevant to contemporary community needs.",Hoelbaek

Biodiversity,"Based on the available information, Holbæk Municipality has been actively involved in several biodiversity initiatives, though specific details are limited.

## Recent Forest Restoration Project

Holbæk Municipality is home to a significant biodiversity project on the island of Orø in the Isefjord. EcoTree launched a sustainable forest project in April 2024, transforming 9.9 hectares of depleted agricultural land into the Orø-Margrete Forest[[https://ecotree.green/en/blog/from-depleted-farmland-to-new-mixed-species-forest]]. This initiative involves planting more than 40,000 trees of 10 different species, including Winter Oak, Common Beech, Hornbeam, and Larch, designed to enhance local biodiversity and forest resilience to climate change[[https://ecotree.green/en/blog/from-depleted-farmland-to-new-mixed-species-forest]]. The area includes special groundwater interests and coastal proximity zones, with 3.3 hectares dedicated to forest edges to improve the forest climate and biological value[[https://ecotree.green/en/blog/from-depleted-farmland-to-new-mixed-species-forest]].

## Community-Based Green Initiatives

Holbæk Municipality has embraced a **mosaic governance** approach to biodiversity management, entrusting green volunteers with managing cattle on municipal commons and facilitating volunteer-led green initiatives[[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09640568.2024.2346592]]. This demonstrates a collaborative model where the municipality works alongside citizens to maintain and enhance natural areas.

## Broader Context

The municipality's work on recreational areas with urban nature and parks has been documented as part of Denmark's broader urban biodiversity efforts[[https://thegreencities.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Gron-norm-2.0-ENG-MAR-2021-WEB.pdf]]. These initiatives align with Denmark's national movement toward nature restoration, including the ambitious Tripartite Agreement goal to restore 140,000 hectares of low-lying farmland into natural areas like meadows and wetlands[[https://scalgo.com/da/blog/rewilding-and-restoring-danish-landscapes]].",Hoelbaek
Attract more education opportunities to Holbeak,"## Attracting More Education Opportunities to Holbæk: Context and Insights

**Holbæk’s Unique Educational Landscape**

Holbæk has taken a proactive, innovative approach to expanding higher education opportunities through the establishment of HUSC (Holbæk Uddannelses- og Studiecenter), a municipal learning and study center that is unique in Denmark[[https://epale.ec.europa.eu/en/organisations/husc-holbaek-uddannelses-og-studiecenter]][[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]]. HUSC was created in response to national educational reforms and institutional mergers that left Holbæk without local higher education providers, prompting the municipality to become an active educational actor rather than just a stakeholder[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].

**Current Offerings and Partnerships**

- **Programs and Institutions:** HUSC hosts around 400 local students and provides study facilities for residents enrolled at other universities. It rents teaching and administration spaces to University College Absalon (offering nursing and, since 2023, early childhood and social education programs) and Zealand Academy of Technologies and Business (offering financial management)[[https://epale.ec.europa.eu/en/organisations/husc-holbaek-uddannelses-og-studiecenter]][[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]]. These programs are closely aligned with local labor market needs, such as healthcare and public administration[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].
- **Flexible Learning Environment:** The center offers 24-hour access to study spaces, catering to students balancing work, family, and studies. This flexibility is a key draw for local residents who might otherwise commute to nearby municipalities[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].
- **Community and Stakeholder Engagement:** HUSC operates a collaborative network (the HUSC Forum) involving local policymakers, businesses, and educational institutions to ensure programs meet regional needs. For example, the introduction of a financial management program was a direct result of stakeholder input[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].

**Strategic Goals and Outcomes**

- **Local Retention:** HUSC aims to retain students within Holbæk by offering relevant, accessible programs. Most students come from Holbæk, Odsherred, Kalundborg, and a few nearby municipalities—individuals who prefer to study close to home[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].
- **Diverse Student Body:** The student population includes recent high school graduates, young parents, and adults returning to education, reflecting a broad demographic appeal[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].

- **Challenges remain in institutional branding and adapting to demographic and national educational trends**[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].

**In summary, Holbæk’s approach to attracting more education opportunities is characterized by municipal innovation, strategic partnerships, and a focus on local needs—offering a replicable model for other small and medium-sized cities seeking to anchor education and talent locally**[[https://epale.ec.europa.eu/en/organisations/husc-holbaek-uddannelses-og-studiecenter]][[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].",Hoelbaek
Tollose street zone,"The **Tølløse Streetzone** is a community-driven urban development project in Tølløse, a railway town of approximately 4,007 residents located in Holbæk Municipality in northwestern Zealand[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%B8ll%C3%B8se]]. This project directly addresses the needs of local youth and promotes active community engagement in an area where traditional recreational options have been limited.

## Project Background and Motivation

Tølløse has a substantial young population, with 662 children aged 6-16 residing in the town, plus an additional 700 youth attending the local folkeskole, two private schools, three efterskole (continuation schools), and a specialized school[[https://lag-nvs.dk/projekt/toelloese-streetzone/]]. Despite this significant demographic, young people in Tølløse have faced limited options for leisure activities beyond traditional organized sports that typically occur in the afternoon hours[[https://lag-nvs.dk/projekt/toelloese-streetzone/]].

The project emerged from concerns about youth wellbeing that mirror broader national trends—specifically, the tendency for children and young people to experience isolation and excessive screen time[[https://lag-nvs.dk/projekt/toelloese-streetzone/]]. Local volunteers recognized the urgent need for a physical gathering space where youth could engage in unstructured, active recreation.

## Project Components and Objectives

The Tølløse Streetzone aims to create facilities and spaces that encourage children, young people, and older residents to participate in diverse physical activities beyond organized sports[[https://lag-nvs.dk/projekt/toelloese-streetzone/]]. The project is strategically located adjacent to the town's existing hall, making it accessible and integrated into the community's infrastructure[[https://lag-nvs.dk/projekt/toelloese-streetzone/]].

A central component of the streetzone is a **skatepark**, for which the organizing group Tølløse Skaterpark Støtteforening received **200,000 kr in funding** from LAG Nordvestsjælland (Local Action Group Northwest Zealand)[[https://lag-nvs.dk/projekt/toelloese-streetzone/]]. This skatepark represents one element of the broader streetzone concept, which is designed to serve as both an activity space and a social gathering point where young people are explicitly welcomed to meet and congregate[[https://lag-nvs.dk/projekt/toelloese-streetzone/]].

## Relevance to Holbæk's Urban Planning Context

This project aligns with Holbæk Municipality's broader commitment to sustainable community development and climate-conscious urban planning. The municipality has set ambitious targets, including a 70% CO2 reduction by 2030[[https://flexsus.org/about/municipalites/]][[https://www.ea-energianalyse.dk/en/cases/climate-plan-for-holbaek-municipality/]], and emphasizes creating livable spaces for all residents across its 18 local areas covering 578.33 km²[[https://flexsus.org/about/municipalites/]].

The streetzone exemplifies the kind of grassroots, community-focused initiative that complements municipal-level strategic planning, addressing social wellbeing and physical activity—both recognized priorities in contemporary Nordic urban development approaches.",Hoelbaek
"Better infrasturccture, ""fjordstien""","The Fjordstien (Cycle Route 40) is a 275-kilometer cycling and hiking route that directly connects to Holbæk and represents a significant infrastructure asset for the city[[https://friluftsdata.dk/upPdfs/FolderHolb%C3%A6k_GB__406.pdf]]. This long-distance path circumnavigates both the Isefjord and Roskilde Fjord, with Holbæk positioned as a key waypoint along the route[[https://www.komoot.com/collection/3610506/following-the-fjordstien-cycle-route-40]].

## Fjordstien's Role in Holbæk's Infrastructure

The route passes through Holbæk as part of a multi-day cycling journey, with the city serving as an overnight stop on day 3 of the typical five-day circuit that starts and ends in Roskilde[[https://www.komoot.com/collection/3610506/following-the-fjordstien-cycle-route-40]]. The path follows the western shoreline of the Isefjord when approaching and departing Holbæk, providing cyclists with views of the fjord as a constant companion[[https://www.komoot.com/collection/3610506/following-the-fjordstien-cycle-route-40]].

**Direct access** to the Fjordstien is available from the Outdoor Gateway Holbæk Fjord, a facility located at Holbæk Fjord Camping and Wellness Centre at the edge of the city[[https://friluftsdata.dk/upPdfs/FolderHolb%C3%A6k_GB__406.pdf]]. This gateway serves as a central node for outdoor activities and provides rental bicycles that can be dropped off at ten different locations in Odsherred, facilitating one-way cycling trips along the route[[https://friluftsdata.dk/upPdfs/FolderHolb%C3%A6k_GB__406.pdf]].

## Infrastructure Connections

From Holbæk, the Fjordstien continues southward around Tempelkrogen, a narrow inlet known for its birdlife and tranquility, winding through quiet farmland and low-lying wetlands[[https://www.komoot.com/collection/3610506/following-the-fjordstien-cycle-route-40]]. The route connects to other long-distance paths including Fjernvandrevej E6 and Gudernes Stræde, making Holbæk a junction point for multiple recreational infrastructure corridors[[https://friluftsdata.dk/upPdfs/FolderHolb%C3%A6k_GB__406.pdf]].

The city's position on this established cycling network, combined with facilities like the Outdoor Gateway offering guided tours and bike rentals, creates opportunities for Holbæk to leverage the Fjordstien as both a recreational amenity for residents and a tourism draw that brings cyclists into the city center.",Hoelbaek
Fjord bye 5000 housings,"Based on the search results, I can provide you with specific information about the Fjordbyen development project in Holbæk, though it appears the scale may be different from the ""5000 housings"" you mentioned.

## The Fjordbyen Development Project

Gefion Group is leading an ambitious urban development project called Fjordbyen (Fjord City) by Holbæk Fjord, which represents a completely new and green district for the city[[https://en.gefiongroup.com/c/news/local-plan-for-fjordbyen-in-holbaek-initiated]]. The Holbæk municipality's economic committee unanimously decided to initiate the local planning process for this development[[https://en.gefiongroup.com/c/news/local-plan-for-fjordbyen-in-holbaek-initiated]].

HUSC,"## HUSC in the Context of Holbæk: Key Insights for City Planners

**HUSC (Holbæk Uddannelses- og Studiecenter)** is a unique municipal initiative in Holbæk, Denmark, designed to attract, develop, and anchor higher education locally, directly responding to the city’s demographic, economic, and social context[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]][[https://epale.ec.europa.eu/en/organisations/husc-holbaek-uddannelses-og-studiecenter]]. Here’s what makes HUSC particularly relevant for city planners focused on Holbæk’s development:

### Municipal Innovation in Higher Education

- **Local Response to National Gaps**: After national reforms and institutional mergers left Holbæk without higher education providers, the municipality launched HUSC in 2016 as a pilot project to retain local students and promote regional development through education[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]][[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-six-nordic-case-studies-.html]].
- **Hybrid Educational Model**: HUSC is not a traditional university but a municipal center that hosts state-funded higher education institutions (Absalon University College and Zealand Academy) under one roof, with the municipality as facility owner and partner[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]][[https://epale.ec.europa.eu/en/organisations/husc-holbaek-uddannelses-og-studiecenter]]. This model is the first of its kind in Denmark[[https://epale.ec.europa.eu/en/organisations/husc-holbaek-uddannelses-og-studiecenter]].
- **Programs Aligned with Local Needs**: Courses offered—such as nursing, pedagogy, and financial management—are closely tied to Holbæk’s labor market, including partnerships with Holbæk Hospital and local schools. There are plans to expand into teacher training, construction management, and computer science, reflecting ongoing dialogue with local employers and the Educational Advisory Board (Uddannelsesråd)[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].
- **Flexible, Accessible Learning**: HUSC provides 24-hour study facilities, catering to students balancing work, family, and studies. It also serves as a community hub for students enrolled elsewhere but living locally, fostering a sense of belonging and reducing out-migration of young talent[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]][[https://epale.ec.europa.eu/en/organisations/husc-holbaek-uddannelses-og-studiecenter]].

### Governance and Community Engagement

- **Steering Group and Forum**: HUSC is steered by a municipal group and supported by the HUSC Forum, a network of local stakeholders (business, education, policymakers) that ensures programs remain relevant to Holbæk’s needs[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].
- **Student Life and Inclusion**: The municipality supports a student NGO, “Godt Studieliv Holbæk,” to enrich student life. Career and education days connect students with local and regional employers, strengthening the link between education and the labor market[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].
- **Inclusive Access**: HUSC explicitly aims to broaden access, including for students with fewer opportunities, and to increase the share of local residents pursuing higher education without leaving the municipality[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]][[https://epale.ec.europa.eu/en/organisations/husc-holbaek-uddannelses-og-studiecenter]].

### Strategic Importance for Holbæk’s Development

- **Economic and Social Development**: By anchoring higher education locally, HUSC helps address workforce challenges (e.g., in construction and healthcare), supports lifelong learning, and contributes to Holbæk’s attractiveness as a place to live and work[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].
- **Innovation Through Experimentation**: HUSC operates as a “minimum viable product,” testing hybrid educational formats and organizational models. This approach allows Holbæk to adapt quickly to changing needs and serves as a prototype for other municipalities[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].
- **Holistic Urban Planning**: HUSC’s success depends on close collaboration between municipal departments, educational institutions, employers, and the community—a model of integrated, cross-sector urban development[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].

### Online Resources

- **Nordregio Case Study**: Provides a detailed overview of HUSC’s origins, structure, programs, and strategic role in Holbæk[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]].
- **EPALE Profile**: Confirms HUSC’s unique status as Denmark’s only municipal higher education center of this kind and lists current study programs[[https://epale.ec.europa.eu/en/organisations/husc-holbaek-uddannelses-og-studiecenter]].

## Conclusion

For city planners in Holbæk, HUSC represents a bold, locally tailored response to the challenges of retaining talent, meeting labor market needs, and fostering inclusive, lifelong learning. Its hybrid governance, focus on local relevance, and emphasis on community engagement make it a compelling case study in municipal innovation and integrated urban development[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-10-higher-education-beyond-major-urban-areas-in-the-nordics/3-1-the-university-and-study-centre-of-holbaek-denmark.html]][[https://epale.ec.europa.eu/en/organisations/husc-holbaek-uddannelses-og-studiecenter]].",Hoelbaek
Sports byeu(?),"In the context of Holbæk, the ""Sportsby"" refers to **Holbæk Sportsby**, a large sports complex in Holbæk, Denmark. Here are some key points about it:

- **Size and Facilities**: Holbæk Sportsby is one of Scandinavia's largest sports complexes, covering 23,000 square meters indoors and 47 hectares outdoors. It includes facilities like swimming pools, racket sports, multi-halls, mountain bike tracks, and a modern health center with training facilities and treatment rooms[[https://www.troldtekt.com/themes/architecture-for-sports-and-movement/sports-complex-brings-together-elite-sports-and-rehabilitation-under-one-roof/]][[https://www.troldtekt.com/references/sport/sports-complex-holbaek-sportsby/]].

- **Design and Purpose**: The complex is designed like a city with houses, streets, and inviting spaces. It aims to bring together all of Holbæk's sports facilities in one place, creating new communities and fostering synergies between elite sports, rehabilitation, and social activities[[https://www.troldtekt.com/themes/architecture-for-sports-and-movement/sports-complex-brings-together-elite-sports-and-rehabilitation-under-one-roof/]][[https://www.troldtekt.com/references/sport/sports-complex-holbaek-sportsby/]].

- **Integration with the Community**: The sports complex serves as a gathering place for both children and adults, hosting various sports activities and cultural events. It is used by 27 clubs and associations, making it a central hub for community engagement[[https://www.troldtekt.com/references/sport/sports-complex-holbaek-sportsby/]][[https://www.visitdenmark.com/denmark/plan-your-trip/holbaek-sportsby-gdk1117993]].

- **Architectural Features**: The building incorporates robust materials like steel, concrete, and wood to ensure durability and good acoustics. It features a calming grey color scheme with bespoke colors in various parts of the complex[[https://www.troldtekt.com/themes/architecture-for-sports-and-movement/sports-complex-brings-together-elite-sports-and-rehabilitation-under-one-roof/]][[https://www.troldtekt.com/references/sport/sports-complex-holbaek-sportsby/]]. 

This information highlights Holbæk Sportsby's role in enhancing the city's recreational and social infrastructure.",Hoelbaek
District heating,"Holbaek has embarked on one of Denmark's most ambitious district heating transitions, with several unique features specific to its context:

## The Green Transition Challenge

Holbaek holds the distinction of being **Denmark's largest gas-heated city**, with approximately 30,000 inhabitants and 64% of heating currently based on oil or natural gas[[https://innargi.com/biggest-gas-heated-city-in-denmark-enters-into-agreement-about-geothermal-district-heating/]][[https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/innargi-to-develop-geothermal-district-heating-in-holbaek-denmark/]]. This makes the district heating rollout both crucial and exceptionally challenging compared to other Danish municipalities. The Municipal Council approved phase 1 in March 2024, with the first heat customers expected to have district heating by the end of 2025, and the complete rollout finishing by the end of 2028[[https://dbdh.org/the-district-heating-rollout-in-holbaek-city-can-now-begin/]].

## Phased Implementation Strategy

The rollout follows a six-phase approach spanning nearly a decade. Phase 1 (2025-2028) targets large heat consumers including housing associations, municipal institutions, and the hospital[[https://dbdh.org/the-district-heating-rollout-in-holbaek-city-can-now-begin/]]. A critical requirement for moving forward is achieving **70% sign-up rate** from heat consumers, making community engagement essential for the project's success[[https://dbdh.org/the-district-heating-rollout-in-holbaek-city-can-now-begin/]]. Subsequent phases extend through 2034, with areas like Svinninge and Tølløse still under consideration[[https://dbdh.org/the-district-heating-rollout-in-holbaek-city-can-now-begin/]].

## Geothermal Energy Integration

What makes Holbaek particularly special is its modern, energy-efficient district heating network designed to operate at approximately 80°C in winter[[https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/innargi-to-develop-geothermal-district-heating-in-holbaek-denmark/]]. This temperature range is perfectly suited for geothermal heating, as the expected geothermal water temperature falls between 60-80°C, requiring minimal power for heating pumps[[https://innargi.com/biggest-gas-heated-city-in-denmark-enters-into-agreement-about-geothermal-district-heating/]][[https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/innargi-to-develop-geothermal-district-heating-in-holbaek-denmark/]]. Utility company Fors has partnered with geothermal developer Innargi to provide **two well pairs supplying 15-30 MW**, with delivery anticipated toward the end of 2026[[https://innargi.com/biggest-gas-heated-city-in-denmark-enters-into-agreement-about-geothermal-district-heating/]][[https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/innargi-to-develop-geothermal-district-heating-in-holbaek-denmark/]].

## Industrial Surplus Heat Potential

Holbaek has access to significant surplus heat from industrial production in neighboring Kalundborg. A district cooling system investment of €1.4 billion could generate enough surplus heat to potentially replace natural gas entirely in Holbaek[[https://www.symbiosis.dk/en/2022/10/21/fjernkoling-har-stort-potentiale-for-udnyttelse-af-overskudsvarme-fra-kalundborg-symbiose/]]. This cross-municipal collaboration represents an innovative approach to leveraging industrial waste heat for residential heating needs.

## Local Governance Model

The project is driven by the municipally-owned utility Fors A/S, following Denmark's non-profit district heating principle where municipalities deliver approximately two-thirds of all district heating[[https://gemeinschaffen.com/gem/projekt/ENER/122]]. This governance structure ensures community-oriented decision-making while navigating the complex coordination required between citizens, institutions, and infrastructure development[[https://dbdh.org/the-district-heating-rollout-in-holbaek-city-can-now-begin/]].",Hoelbaek
Jyderup Bymidte Project trategy for city centre,"The **Jyderup Bymidte Project strategy for city centre** is a targeted initiative within Holbæk Municipality focused on revitalizing Jyderup’s town centre through a combination of urban, social, and economic measures specific to the local context[[https://jyderup.dk/bymidteprojektet-2/]][[https://jyderup.dk/vores_lokalomraade/borgerinitiativer-aktiviteter-eller-projekter/jyderups_groenne_hjerte/]][[https://holbaek.dk/politik-og-demokrati/planer-og-projekter/lokal-udvikling-og-tilskud/aktuelle-lokale-projekter/baeredygtigt-jyderup-faelles-om-en-aktiv-bymidte-midt-i-byen]].

Key elements specific to Holbæk and Jyderup include:

- **Integration of Nature and Urban Life:** The strategy builds on Jyderup’s vision to become an *active town in nature*, leveraging its proximity to forests, Naturpark Åmosen, and Skarresø. Plans include establishing green corridors to strengthen the connection between the town centre and surrounding nature, making Jyderup a destination for both nature and culture[[https://jyderup.dk/bymidteprojektet-2/]].

- **Public-Private Collaboration:** The project emphasizes cooperation between local actors, businesses, associations, and Holbæk Municipality to ensure a holistic approach to development. This collaboration is seen as essential for realizing the vision and implementing concrete improvements in the town centre[[https://jyderup.dk/bymidteprojektet-2/]][[https://holbaek.dk/politik-og-demokrati/planer-og-projekter/lokal-udvikling-og-tilskud/aktuelle-lokale-projekter/baeredygtigt-jyderup-faelles-om-en-aktiv-bymidte-midt-i-byen]].

- **Infrastructure Adaptation:** Upcoming changes, such as the removal of motorway ramps due to the extension of Kalundborgmotorvejen, will increase traffic on Skarridsøgade. The strategy addresses the need to rethink physical spaces in the centre to improve mobility, access, and the overall experience for residents and visitors[[https://jyderup.dk/bymidteprojektet-2/]].

- **Revitalizing Retail and Commerce:** Jyderup’s retail sector, concentrated around Skarridsøgade, has seen an 11% decline in shops over five years. The strategy aims to counteract this trend by fostering closer cooperation among businesses, associations, and citizens, creating a more attractive and vibrant town centre to support local economic growth[[https://jyderup.dk/bymidteprojektet-2/]].

- **Placemaking and Community Spaces:** There is a strong focus on transforming the central station square into a greener, more welcoming, and multifunctional space for all age groups. The aim is to create a “heart of the town” that encourages community, culture, and business activities, with features for recreation, play, and biodiversity[[https://jyderup.dk/vores_lokalomraade/borgerinitiativer-aktiviteter-eller-projekter/jyderups_groenne_hjerte/]].

- **Funding and Implementation:** Holbæk Municipality has allocated funds for the development of public spaces in Jyderup, supporting the strategy’s goals of a green and sustainable town centre. Specific projects include the demolition and replacement of outdated buildings to improve the urban environment[[https://jyderup.dk/vores_lokalomraade/borgerinitiativer-aktiviteter-eller-projekter/jyderups_groenne_hjerte/]].

- **Strategic Process:** In spring 2025, Holbæk Kommune initiated a project to develop a comprehensive strategy for Jyderup’s town centre, with the goal of strengthening local identity, community, and economic resilience[[https://holbaek.dk/politik-og-demokrati/planer-og-projekter/lokal-udvikling-og-tilskud/aktuelle-lokale-projekter/baeredygtigt-jyderup-faelles-om-en-aktiv-bymidte-midt-i-byen]].

"Better conditions for vulnerable groups, especially children","**Holbaek has been directly involved in projects focused on promoting well-being and better conditions for vulnerable groups, including children, through urban planning and co-creation initiatives.** The most relevant and specific information comes from the interdisciplinary project ""The Urban Health Culture of the Future,"" in which Holbaek Municipality was a project partner[[https://juulfrost.dk/sites/default/files/node/field_file/Tools%20to%20promote%20physical,%20mental,%20and%20social%20well-being%20in%20the%20built%20environment..pdf]].

Key points specific to Holbaek:

- **Holbaek Municipality participated as a project partner** in ""The Urban Health Culture of the Future,"" an initiative supported by Realdania and Juul Frost Architects, aimed at integrating health and well-being into urban planning[[https://juulfrost.dk/sites/default/files/node/field_file/Tools%20to%20promote%20physical,%20mental,%20and%20social%20well-being%20in%20the%20built%20environment..pdf]]. This project developed tools and strategies to promote *physical, mental, and social well-being* in the built environment, with a focus on inclusivity for all social groups, including vulnerable children.

- The project emphasizes a **holistic approach** to well-being, addressing social, physical, and mental needs. It advocates for urban spaces and green areas that are developed with a demographic approach, considering the diverse needs of different age groups, including children, and ensuring coherence between the physical environment and residents' needs[[https://juulfrost.dk/sites/default/files/node/field_file/Tools%20to%20promote%20physical,%20mental,%20and%20social%20well-being%20in%20the%20built%20environment..pdf]].

- **Co-creation and community involvement** are highlighted as essential strategies. The project recommends creating citizen-driven initiatives, such as cultural centers and spaces where volunteers act as hosts to foster social inclusion and bridge-building between different groups. This approach is intended to help vulnerable children and families feel included and supported in the community[[https://juulfrost.dk/sites/default/files/node/field_file/Tools%20to%20promote%20physical,%20mental,%20and%20social%20well-being%20in%20the%20built%20environment..pdf]].

- The project also stresses the importance of **social architecture**—not just building physical spaces, but also facilitating ongoing social initiatives and community-building activities after the completion of physical projects. This includes supporting local sports clubs, leisure activities, and resident-driven communities that can empower vulnerable groups and promote social cohesion[[https://juulfrost.dk/sites/default/files/node/field_file/Tools%20to%20promote%20physical,%20mental,%20and%20social%20well-being%20in%20the%20built%20environment..pdf]].

- The tools and strategies developed in this project are designed to be *applicable and feasible* in municipalities like Holbaek, which are described as economically advantaged and generally integrated cities[[https://juulfrost.dk/sites/default/files/node/field_file/Tools%20to%20promote%20physical,%20mental,%20and%20social%20well-being%20in%20the%20built%20environment..pdf]].

In summary, **Holbaek has been actively involved in developing and applying innovative, inclusive urban planning strategies to improve conditions for vulnerable groups, especially children, through holistic well-being initiatives and community co-creation**[[https://juulfrost.dk/sites/default/files/node/field_file/Tools%20to%20promote%20physical,%20mental,%20and%20social%20well-being%20in%20the%20built%20environment..pdf]].",Hoelbaek
Holbeak station and cityhall Project,"Based on the search results, there is no specific project called the ""Holbaek Station and Cityhall Project"" mentioned. However, I can identify relevant initiatives involving Holbæk Station that are pertinent to city planning:

## The Connected Journey Mobility Project

Holbæk Station is central to ""The Connected Journey"" mobility project, which aims to develop mobility offers and a mobility hub adapted for potential users in Region Zealand[[https://gate21.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Case-Descriptions_09.02.2024_ENG.pdf]]. The project focuses on creating attractive nodes to offer a coherent and easy journey experience for passengers using public transport, with the goal of encouraging a mode shift from private cars to public transport[[https://gate21.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Case-Descriptions_09.02.2024_ENG.pdf]].

**Key aspects relevant to city planning:**

The target group includes commuters who work or study close to the transport hub but lack an attractive transport and service offering, leading them to choose private cars for their entire journey[[https://gate21.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Case-Descriptions_09.02.2024_ENG.pdf]]. The project involves collaboration between Region Zealand (project owner), Gate 21 (project management), Movia, and Holbæk Municipality[[https://gate21.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Case-Descriptions_09.02.2024_ENG.pdf]].

Holbæk Municipality has incorporated nodes and shared mobility into its new mobility plan as a separate area of action, with cycling initiatives for employees at Holbæk Townhall mentioned as one initiative[[https://gate21.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Case-Descriptions_09.02.2024_ENG.pdf]]. A vision plan for future transformation of the station was adopted in January 2024[[https://gate21.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Case-Descriptions_09.02.2024_ENG.pdf]].

The station's strategic location places it within walking distance of key destinations: Holbæk Hospital (approximately 1 km), educational institutions (approximately 1-2.5 km away), the nearest supermarket (600 meters), and Ahlgade shopping area (400 meters)[[https://gate21.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Case-Descriptions_09.02.2024_ENG.pdf]].

Regarding infrastructure specifically connecting the station and town hall, the search results indicate that Holbæk Townhall is among the mapped destinations near the station[[https://gate21.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Case-Descriptions_09.02.2024_ENG.pdf]], but no dedicated joint project between these two facilities is mentioned.",Hoelbaek
City densifying,"Denmark has actively pursued urban densification policies since the mid-1990s as a core strategy for achieving sustainable urban development[[https://www.witpress.com/Secure/elibrary/papers/URS02/URS02049FU.pdf]][[https://blogs.ubc.ca/lisatam/2013/04/08/urban-densification-in-copenhagen-with-a-special-focus-on-the-osterbro-district/]]. The Danish national government supported this approach believing that higher densities would create more efficient infrastructure, reduce distances between urban functions, and improve overall energy efficiency[[https://www.witpress.com/Secure/elibrary/papers/URS02/URS02049FU.pdf]].

## Copenhagen's Leadership in Densification

Copenhagen serves as the primary example of Danish densification efforts. The city has experienced significant building activity, particularly in inner-city regeneration projects that include former harbor areas, derelict sites, old military barracks, and smaller sites in lower-density urban districts[[https://www.witpress.com/Secure/elibrary/papers/URS02/URS02049FU.pdf]]. The Østerbro district experienced a 5.9% increase in population density during the 1990s, exceeding Copenhagen's municipal average, with the general plot ratio increasing from 300% to 330%[[https://www.witpress.com/Secure/elibrary/papers/URS02/URS02049FU.pdf]][[https://blogs.ubc.ca/lisatam/2013/04/08/urban-densification-in-copenhagen-with-a-special-focus-on-the-osterbro-district/]].

## Strategic Approaches to Housing Supply

Danish urban development employs three distinct strategies for increasing housing capacity[[https://copenhageneconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/copenhagen-economics-2018-housing-market-analysis-of-greater-copenhagen-english-summary.pdf]]:

**Strategy 1** focuses on developing previously undeveloped areas that hold future potential without significantly compromising green spaces or requiring extensive new infrastructure.

**Strategy 2** emphasizes densification of existing urban areas through demolishing and rebuilding, filling gaps between buildings, adding extensions, or building higher. Copenhagen specifically targets unused roof spaces, lofts, and sparsely built central areas, while suburbs focus on densification around transit stations[[https://copenhageneconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/copenhagen-economics-2018-housing-market-analysis-of-greater-copenhagen-english-summary.pdf]].

**Strategy 3** involves more efficient use of existing building stock by converting non-residential buildings into dwellings and increasing mobility in social housing and regulated rental markets[[https://copenhageneconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/copenhagen-economics-2018-housing-market-analysis-of-greater-copenhagen-english-summary.pdf]].

## The Finger Plan Framework

Denmark's most celebrated urban planning achievement is Copenhagen's metropolitan ""Finger Plan,"" initiated in 1945-1947[[https://academic.oup.com/book/42635/chapter/358102557]]. This comprehensive public plan successfully prevented urban sprawl for over seventy years by creating distinct urban corridors (""fingers"") separated by protected green wedges. The plan strictly prohibits construction of shopping malls and new neighborhoods in these green areas, ensuring residents have easy access to both rapid transit and recreational green spaces[[https://academic.oup.com/book/42635/chapter/358102557]]. This approach was included in Denmark's national list of outstanding cultural heritage sites in 2006[[https://academic.oup.com/book/42635/chapter/358102557]].

## Governance and Implementation Challenges

Danish spatial planning operates through a multilevel governance system integrating land use, transport, and building sectors under the Danish Planning Act[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-8-nordic-cities-pathways-towards-climate-neutrality/7-denmark.html]]. Municipalities hold significant autonomy in local planning, preparing zoning regulations and managing building permits[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-8-nordic-cities-pathways-towards-climate-neutrality/7-denmark.html]]. However, this autonomy has created tensions—particularly regarding early-stage planning requirements that force municipalities to make detailed decisions on architectural designs and materials far in advance, sometimes resulting in outdated plans by the time development begins[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-8-nordic-cities-pathways-towards-climate-neutrality/7-denmark.html]].

## Balancing Densification with Environmental Goals

A persistent challenge in Danish densification involves balancing urban growth with preservation of green spaces. In Vejle Municipality, the city densifies by building vertically while maintaining policies that preserve the green skyline, creating a dichotomy between growth demands and landscape preservation[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-8-nordic-cities-pathways-towards-climate-neutrality/7-denmark.html]]. The municipality developed a Blue Green Strategy that prioritizes assessing green and blue space locations before determining building sites, ensuring biodiversity considerations precede development planning[[https://pub.nordregio.org/r-2025-8-nordic-cities-pathways-towards-climate-neutrality/7-denmark.html]].

The Copenhagen Region Development Council anticipated that densification in central areas would reduce travel distances and increase public transportation use, though future densification opportunities within central Copenhagen are becoming limited, shifting focus to suburban areas[[https://blogs.ubc.ca/lisatam/2013/04/08/urban-densification-in-copenhagen-with-a-special-focus-on-the-osterbro-district/]].",Denmark
Less burocracy in civil society,"Denmark has undertaken several significant initiatives to reduce bureaucracy specifically for civil society organizations and volunteer associations.

In August 2025, the Danish government presented a comprehensive plan containing 30 initiatives aimed at reducing bureaucracy for associations and volunteers across the country[[https://cphpost.dk/2025-08-19/news/round-up/government-removes-bureaucracy-for-associations-and-volunteers/]]. This plan addresses a longstanding concern in Denmark's civil society sector, where bureaucratic burdens have been recognized as obstacles to running associations and participating in volunteer work. A key measure in this plan involves simplifying building regulations—associations will now work with a single set of building rules instead of having to navigate multiple overlapping regulations[[https://cphpost.dk/2025-08-19/news/round-up/government-removes-bureaucracy-for-associations-and-volunteers/]].

## Background and Context

The push for bureaucratic reduction has been building for several years. In February 2020, members of parliament from the Danish party 'Venstre' proposed a resolution to support and strengthen associations and the voluntary sector through various actions, including reducing bureaucracy by using the derogation clause in the Data Protection Directive and investigating tax exemptions for associations[[https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/franet_denmark_civic_space_2021.pdf]]. This resolution highlighted the recognition across political parties that Denmark's civil society faces unnecessary administrative challenges.

## Current Requirements and Challenges

Danish civil society organizations currently operate under specific requirements when applying for funding. Organizations must meet minimum standards including having approved statutes, accounts subject to auditing, and maintaining a minimum number of paying Danish contributors—25 for applications up to DKK 500,000 and 50 for larger applications[[https://cisu.dk/media/zeynrgmm/csp-guidelines-11-en.pdf]]. These contributors may be members, volunteers, or financial contributors, with no minimum contribution size required[[https://cisu.dk/media/zeynrgmm/csp-guidelines-11-en.pdf]].

The bureaucratic landscape for Danish civil society reflects the broader tension in Denmark's governance model between ensuring uniform standards across the country while allowing local autonomy. This tension creates additional administrative layers that organizations must navigate when delivering services or implementing programs[[https://www.sgi-network.org/docs/2024/country/SGI2024_Denmark.pdf]].",Denmark
Stay as long as possible at home,"The topic of **""Stay as long as possible at home""**—often associated with aging in place, independent living for seniors, and accessible housing—has specific relevance in Denmark’s urban planning and social policy context.

Key points specific to Denmark:

- **Senior Housing and Aging in Place:** Denmark recognizes the demographic trend of an aging population and the need for more social housing options that allow elderly citizens to remain in their homes and communities as long as possible. Danish municipalities are legally required to provide social housing suitable for elderly people and those with disabilities who have special needs. There is a dedicated senior housing pool (DKK 50 million, 2022–2026) for demonstration projects that convert existing social housing to be more suitable for seniors, supporting the goal of enabling older adults to stay at home longer[[https://www.feantsa.org/public/user/epoch/National-Strategies/Homelessness-Strategy-Denmark-Original2024.pdf]].

- **Age-Friendly Urban Design:** Danish policy acknowledges that loneliness among the elderly is rising, which can lead to health problems. Accessibility and activities in urban spaces are seen as crucial for elderly people to get out, socialize, and experience community. To address this, Denmark has allocated funds (DKK 30 million, 2023–2025) specifically for elderly-friendly design of urban spaces, aiming to make cities more supportive of seniors’ independence and well-being[[https://www.feantsa.org/public/user/epoch/National-Strategies/Homelessness-Strategy-Denmark-Original2024.pdf]].

- **Accessible Housing:** New social housing in Denmark is generally built to be accessible according to national building regulations, benefiting both elderly residents and people with disabilities. Significant funding (DKK 4.8 billion from the 2020 Green Housing Agreement) has been allocated to promote accessibility in the social housing sector, including subsidized renovations to increase the number of accessible units. There is also a focus on differentiated solutions to accommodate various types of disabilities, supporting the broader goal of allowing people to remain in their homes as their needs change[[https://www.feantsa.org/public/user/epoch/National-Strategies/Homelessness-Strategy-Denmark-Original2024.pdf]].

- **Community and Cohousing Models:** Denmark supports senior cohousing communities as part of its strategy, recognizing that social connection and mutual support are important for enabling seniors to live independently for longer[[https://www.feantsa.org/public/user/epoch/National-Strategies/Homelessness-Strategy-Denmark-Original2024.pdf]].

- **Policy Integration:** These initiatives are part of a broader national strategy that includes sustainable, inclusive urban development and the integration of natural habitats and accessible public spaces, all of which contribute to making it feasible for people to stay in their own homes and neighborhoods as long as possible[[https://www.gehlpeople.com/knowledge-hub/news/denmarks-new-national-architecture-policy-sets-a-bold-vision-for-sustainable-and-inclusive-urban-development/]][[https://www.feantsa.org/public/user/epoch/National-Strategies/Homelessness-Strategy-Denmark-Original2024.pdf]].

These measures are specific to Denmark’s policy landscape and reflect a coordinated approach between national and municipal governments to support aging in place and independent living for vulnerable populations.",Denmark
Citizen focus,"## Citizen Focus in Danish Urban Planning: Context and Innovations

Denmark stands out for its deep-rooted culture of citizen participation in urban planning, with both legal frameworks and innovative practices that emphasize direct democracy, digital inclusion, and co-creation.

### Legal and Cultural Foundations

- **Mandatory Participation:** Danish law requires local authorities to involve citizens in planning processes, especially through formal hearings before final decisions on local changes[[https://www.iied.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/migrate/G01293.pdf]]. This tradition is supported by Denmark’s historical emphasis on lifelong learning and civic engagement, exemplified by the folk high school movement and the philosophy of Hal Koch, who advocated for active citizenship[[https://www.iied.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/migrate/G01293.pdf]].
- **Integrated Democracy:** Denmark blends representative and participatory democracy, ensuring that citizen input is not just symbolic but integrated into decision-making[[https://www.iied.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/migrate/G01293.pdf]].

### Innovative Citizen Participation Methods

- **Participatory Budgeting:** Cities like Aarhus and Copenhagen have implemented participatory budgeting (PB), allowing residents to propose and vote on how to allocate part of the municipal budget. Aarhus uses the Consul Democracy platform, enabling digital participation with national ID authentication (MitID), making the process accessible and secure[[https://docs.consuldemocracy.org/use_cases/denmark/aarhus]]. The city allocates a substantial annual budget (1.3 million euros) exclusively for citizen-proposed projects, fostering local ownership and innovation[[https://docs.consuldemocracy.org/use_cases/denmark/aarhus]].
- **Digital Inclusion:** Denmark’s national digital infrastructure, including government-issued digital mailboxes, ensures widespread access to participatory platforms. This is complemented by training programs, often run by libraries and NGOs, to help all citizens—including the elderly—engage digitally[[https://citiesofservice.jhu.edu/stories/building-on-a-foundation-of-digital-inclusion/]].
- **Citizens’ Assemblies:** Copenhagen has introduced a Citizens’ Assembly (“Københavnerting”), where a representative, randomly selected group deliberates on key city issues and makes recommendations to the city council. This model ensures diverse participation and strengthens the dialogue between citizens and institutions[[https://oidp.net/en/practice.php?id=1410]].
- **Scenario Workshops:** These bring together citizens, policymakers, businesses, and experts to co-create future visions and action plans, using scenarios to explore solutions collaboratively[[https://www.iied.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/migrate/G01293.pdf]].
- **Targeted Engagement:** Danish cities actively seek to include groups traditionally underrepresented in planning, such as youth and ethnic minorities. For example, Aarhus lowered the voting age for PB to 15 to engage younger citizens[[https://citiesofservice.jhu.edu/stories/building-on-a-foundation-of-digital-inclusion/]], while Copenhagen’s area-based initiatives (ABIs) focus on neighborhoods with high levels of social exclusion[[https://forskning.ruc.dk/files/64474135/Innovative_Forms_of_Citizen_Participation_at_the_Fringe_of_the_Formal_Planning_System.pdf]].

### Key Lessons for City Planners

- **Delegate Real Power:** Effective participation requires that citizens’ input leads to tangible outcomes, not just consultation. Cities must ensure that participatory processes influence formal decisions[[https://citiesofservice.jhu.edu/stories/building-on-a-foundation-of-digital-inclusion/]][[https://docs.consuldemocracy.org/use_cases/denmark/aarhus]].
- **Keep It Simple and Accessible:** Digital tools should be user-friendly, with low barriers to entry. National digital ID systems and single sign-on features (e.g., MitID) streamline participation[[https://citiesofservice.jhu.edu/stories/building-on-a-foundation-of-digital-inclusion/]][[https://docs.consuldemocracy.org/use_cases/denmark/aarhus]].
- **Support and Resources:** Successful participation depends on adequate funding, process support, and collaboration with local communities and associations[[https://docs.consuldemocracy.org/use_cases/denmark/aarhus]].
- **Innovate Beyond Formality:** Danish planners are experimenting with creative, informal methods—such as city walks, pop-up events, and digital platforms—to reach citizens who do not engage in traditional hearings[[https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/1680]][[https://forskning.ruc.dk/files/64474135/Innovative_Forms_of_Citizen_Participation_at_the_Fringe_of_the_Formal_Planning_System.pdf]][[https://www.govocal.com/case-studies/copenhagen-proposals-12000-residents-participate]].

### Examples of Impact

- **Aarhus:** Over 16% of eligible residents participated in a PB process in one district, leading to new playgrounds and walking trails developed with city support[[https://citiesofservice.jhu.edu/stories/building-on-a-foundation-of-digital-inclusion/]].
- **Copenhagen:** The Citizens’ Assembly has brought diverse voices into city governance, with recommendations publicly debated by the city council[[https://oidp.net/en/practice.php?id=1410]].
- **Sønderborg:** Citizen participation is central to the city’s green transition, with awareness campaigns empowering residents to contribute to energy savings[[https://denmark.dk/innovation-and-design/urban-solutions]].

## Conclusion

Denmark’s approach to citizen focus in urban planning is characterized by mandatory participation, innovative digital tools, targeted outreach, and a commitment to translating citizen input into action. These practices not only democratize urban governance but also foster social innovation and community resilience[[https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/1680]][[https://citiesofservice.jhu.edu/stories/building-on-a-foundation-of-digital-inclusion/]][[https://docs.consuldemocracy.org/use_cases/denmark/aarhus]]. City planners can draw on these examples to design processes that are inclusive, impactful, and adapted to local contexts.",Denmark
"Better indoor climate in schools, kindergarten","## Indoor Climate in Danish Schools and Kindergartens: Context and Evidence

**Current State and Challenges**

- **Widespread Poor Indoor Climate:** Over half of Danish schools have indoor air quality (IAQ) issues, with 53% of classrooms exceeding the recommended CO₂ threshold of 1,000 ppm, and 18% reaching more than double this level[[https://www.dtu.dk/english/newsarchive/2023/05/godt-indeklima-starter-med-data]]. This is despite ongoing efforts to improve ventilation, indicating that traditional solutions are often insufficient[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]].
- **Health and Performance Impacts:** Poor IAQ is linked to increased sick leave among teachers and reduced student performance. Studies show that better ventilation can improve student performance by up to 9%, and lowering classroom temperature from 25°C to 21°C can yield an 8% improvement[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]].
- **Economic Burden:** Maintaining good indoor climate with conventional mechanical ventilation costs approximately €2,100–€3,000 per class annually, a significant burden for municipalities[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]].

## Specific Danish Context and Solutions

**Building Stock and Renovation Needs**

- **Aging Infrastructure:** About 50% of Danish schools were built in the 1960s and 1970s, originally relying on natural ventilation through windows. Today, most are being retrofitted with mechanical systems, but many still struggle to meet modern standards[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]].
- **Energy and Climate Goals:** There is a push for energy-efficient renovations, but these must not compromise indoor climate. The majority of schools need urgent upgrades to meet current requirements[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]].

**Innovative Ventilation Strategies**

- **NOTECH System:** A recent pilot at Skovbrynet Skole compared a new façade-based, demand-controlled natural ventilation system (NOTECH) with conventional mechanical ventilation. Both systems kept CO₂ below 1,000 ppm, but NOTECH had much lower installation, energy, and maintenance costs (about 35% of mechanical systems) and a 95% lower embedded CO₂ footprint for materials[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]][[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38618018/]]. NOTECH uses intelligent, demand-controlled inlets and outlets, solar chimneys, and eelgrass air filters, adjusting ventilation based on CO₂, temperature, and weather[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]].
- **Daylight and Natural Ventilation:** Renovations at Endrup School demonstrated that adding roof windows and demand-controlled natural ventilation improved both daylight levels and IAQ. Such interventions can reduce reliance on electric lighting and enhance perceived freshness and comfort[[https://www.velux.ca/-/media/com/articles/pdf/indoor%20climate%20in%20a%20renovated%20danish%20school_paper_clima%202016%20a4%20to%20velux%20%20%20%20(002).pdf]].
- **Hybrid Approaches:** The new Danish standard (DS 447) now includes guidelines for mechanical, natural, and hybrid ventilation systems, reflecting a shift toward more flexible, context-sensitive solutions[[https://www.rehva.eu/rehva-journal/chapter/new-danish-standard-for-mechanical-natural-and-hybrid-ventilation-systems]].

## Key Findings from Danish Studies

- **Performance:** Both mechanical and advanced natural ventilation (like NOTECH) can meet regulatory requirements, but natural/hybrid systems offer significant cost and sustainability advantages[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]][[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38618018/]].
- **Seasonal Variations:** CO₂ levels are generally higher in winter, when windows are kept closed. Demand-controlled systems can adapt to seasonal needs, maintaining air quality year-round[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]].
- **Teacher and Student Experience:** Improved daylight and air quality are consistently linked to better concentration, performance, and well-being[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]][[https://www.velux.ca/-/media/com/articles/pdf/indoor%20climate%20in%20a%20renovated%20danish%20school_paper_clima%202016%20a4%20to%20velux%20%20%20%20(002).pdf]].
- **Noise:** High noise levels (above 65 dB(A)) are common in Danish classrooms, further stressing the need for holistic indoor climate solutions[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]].

## Recommendations for City Planners

- **Prioritize Demand-Controlled, Natural/Hybrid Systems:** These can deliver good IAQ at lower cost and with a smaller carbon footprint, especially in older buildings[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]][[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38618018/]].
- **Integrate Daylight Optimization:** Maximizing natural light reduces energy use and supports student performance[[https://www.velux.ca/-/media/com/articles/pdf/indoor%20climate%20in%20a%20renovated%20danish%20school_paper_clima%202016%20a4%20to%20velux%20%20%20%20(002).pdf]].
- **Monitor and Adapt:** Continuous monitoring of CO₂, temperature, humidity, and noise is essential to identify problems and evaluate interventions[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]][[https://www.dtu.dk/english/newsarchive/2023/05/godt-indeklima-starter-med-data]].
- **Engage Stakeholders:** Include teachers and students in the design process to ensure solutions meet real-world needs and are used effectively[[https://www.velux.ca/-/media/com/articles/pdf/indoor%20climate%20in%20a%20renovated%20danish%20school_paper_clima%202016%20a4%20to%20velux%20%20%20%20(002).pdf]].
- **Consider Lifecycle Costs:** Look beyond initial investment to include energy, maintenance, and environmental impact over the building’s lifespan[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]].

## Conclusion

Denmark faces a clear challenge: most schools and kindergartens have poor indoor climates, with significant impacts on health, learning, and municipal budgets. However, Danish research and pilot projects demonstrate that innovative, demand-controlled natural and hybrid ventilation systems—coupled with daylight optimization—can deliver compliant, healthy, and sustainable indoor environments at a fraction of the cost and carbon impact of conventional mechanical systems[[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016168/]][[https://www.velux.ca/-/media/com/articles/pdf/indoor%20climate%20in%20a%20renovated%20danish%20school_paper_clima%202016%20a4%20to%20velux%20%20%20%20(002).pdf]][[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38618018/]]. City planners should prioritize these solutions in renovation and new-build projects to create better learning environments for all.",Denmark
Building DGNB CO2 reduction,"## DGNB CO₂ Reduction in Danish Building Context

Denmark has emerged as a European leader in regulating and reducing embodied carbon in construction, with the DGNB (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen) certification system playing a central role in this transformation[[https://blog.vizcab.io/en/international-blog/denmarks-ambitious-path-in-regulating-embodied-carbon-in-construction]][[https://www.randerstegl.com/responsibility/dgnb-certifications]][[https://stateofgreen.com/en/news/dgnb-a-systematised-approach-to-sustainability/]]. Here’s what’s specific to Denmark regarding “Building DGNB CO₂ reduction”:

### Regulatory Framework and CO₂ Limits

- **Mandatory CO₂ Limits**: Since January 2023, Denmark has enforced a first-of-its-kind regulation capping embodied carbon emissions for new buildings over 1,000 m² at 12 kg CO₂e/m²/year, based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)[[https://blog.vizcab.io/en/international-blog/denmarks-ambitious-path-in-regulating-embodied-carbon-in-construction]][[https://orbit.dtu.dk/files/325679516/1_s2.0_S2666165923000571_main.pdf]]. This limit is set to become stricter over time, with a general limit of 7.1 kg CO₂e/m²/year starting in 2025, and further reductions planned for 2027 and 2029[[https://blog.vizcab.io/en/international-blog/denmarks-ambitious-path-in-regulating-embodied-carbon-in-construction]][[https://www.acembee.com/en/blog/stricter-co2-emissions-requirements-for-new-buildings-in-denmark-a-step-towards-sustainable-construction]].
- **Differentiated Standards**: The regulations are tailored to building types—schools and public buildings face slightly higher limits due to unique requirements, while single-family homes and offices have lower thresholds. This differentiation ensures feasibility across sectors[[https://blog.vizcab.io/en/international-blog/denmarks-ambitious-path-in-regulating-embodied-carbon-in-construction]][[https://www.acembee.com/en/blog/stricter-co2-emissions-requirements-for-new-buildings-in-denmark-a-step-towards-sustainable-construction]].
- **Expanded Scope**: The rules now cover a broader range of buildings, including holiday homes and unheated structures over 50 m², and explicitly include emissions from the construction process (e.g., material transport, on-site activities)[[https://www.acembee.com/en/blog/stricter-co2-emissions-requirements-for-new-buildings-in-denmark-a-step-towards-sustainable-construction]].
- **Exemptions**: Critical infrastructure like hospitals and prisons are exempt but must still document their climate impact[[https://www.acembee.com/en/blog/stricter-co2-emissions-requirements-for-new-buildings-in-denmark-a-step-towards-sustainable-construction]].

### DGNB Certification in Denmark

- **Industry Standard**: Since 2010, DGNB has been the voluntary industry standard for sustainable construction in Denmark, adapted to local conditions[[https://stateofgreen.com/en/news/dgnb-a-systematised-approach-to-sustainability/]]. It evaluates environmental, economic, and socio-cultural quality equally, covering the entire building lifecycle from materials to demolition[[https://www.randerstegl.com/responsibility/dgnb-certifications]][[https://stateofgreen.com/en/news/dgnb-a-systematised-approach-to-sustainability/]].
- **Certification Uptake**: Demand for DGNB certification has grown significantly, now covering about 50% of large-scale new constructions[[https://blog.vizcab.io/en/international-blog/denmarks-ambitious-path-in-regulating-embodied-carbon-in-construction]]. The number of certified and pre-certified projects rose from 20 in 2017 to 97 in 2021, reflecting strong industry engagement[[https://stateofgreen.com/en/news/dgnb-a-systematised-approach-to-sustainability/]].
- **Holistic Assessment**: DGNB certification provides a structured, points-based evaluation leading to silver, gold, or platinum ratings, clearly signaling a building’s sustainability performance[[https://www.randerstegl.com/responsibility/dgnb-certifications]][[https://stateofgreen.com/en/news/dgnb-a-systematised-approach-to-sustainability/]].
- **Life Cycle Focus**: The system’s emphasis on LCA helps identify and reduce the largest sources of CO₂ emissions throughout a building’s life, supporting Denmark’s regulatory goals[[https://www.randerstegl.com/responsibility/dgnb-certifications]][[https://stateofgreen.com/en/news/dgnb-a-systematised-approach-to-sustainability/]].

### Industry and Policy Drivers

- **Private Sector Leadership**: Over 630 Danish companies have voluntarily committed to reducing embodied carbon in line with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C target, creating momentum beyond regulatory requirements[[https://blog.vizcab.io/en/international-blog/denmarks-ambitious-path-in-regulating-embodied-carbon-in-construction]].
- **Continuous Improvement**: The regulatory framework is designed to evolve, with biennial reviews to tighten limits and expand LCA scope (e.g., to include transportation and demolition emissions)[[https://blog.vizcab.io/en/international-blog/denmarks-ambitious-path-in-regulating-embodied-carbon-in-construction]].
- **National Tools**: Denmark has developed its own LCA tool, LCAbyg, to support compliance and innovation, and the government’s 2021 national strategy for sustainable construction sets a clear trajectory for further decarbonization[[https://efiling.energy.ca.gov/getdocument.aspx?tn=239462]].

### Challenges and Innovations

- **Incentive Structure**: Current per-area limits may inadvertently encourage larger buildings, as total allowed emissions rise with size—a recognized issue in ongoing policy discussions[[https://orbit.dtu.dk/files/325679516/1_s2.0_S2666165923000571_main.pdf]].
- **Comprehensive Approach**: Denmark’s regulations and DGNB certification together push the market toward low-carbon materials, energy-efficient design, and circular construction practices[[https://blog.vizcab.io/en/international-blog/denmarks-ambitious-path-in-regulating-embodied-carbon-in-construction]][[https://www.randerstegl.com/responsibility/dgnb-certifications]][[https://stateofgreen.com/en/news/dgnb-a-systematised-approach-to-sustainability/]].
- **International Benchmark**: DGNB is recognized as a global benchmark, and Denmark’s adaptation of it demonstrates how international standards can be tailored to national contexts for maximum impact[[https://stateofgreen.com/en/news/dgnb-a-systematised-approach-to-sustainability/]][[https://archive.nordregio.se/en/Metameny/Nordregio-News/2014/Planning-Tools-for-Urban-Sustainability/Case/index.html]].

More citizens,"The topic of **'More citizens'** in the context of Denmark is closely tied to Denmark’s strong tradition of **inclusive, participatory urban planning** and innovative citizen engagement, especially in city development and smart city initiatives.

Key points specific to Denmark:

- **Deep-rooted participatory culture:** Denmark has a long history of integrating both representative and direct democracy into urban planning. By law, local authorities must send any local area change plans out for public hearing, ensuring citizens have a formal say in development decisions[[https://www.iied.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/migrate/G01293.pdf]]. This tradition is reinforced by historical movements such as the Folk high schools, which promote lifelong education and civic empowerment[[https://www.iied.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/migrate/G01293.pdf]].

- **Innovative citizen assemblies:** Copenhagen has pioneered the use of **citizens’ assemblies** (e.g., ""Københavnerting""), where a randomly selected, demographically representative group of residents deliberate and make recommendations on city development. This process is designed to ensure that the assembly reflects the diversity of the city’s population and strengthens the dialogue between citizens and institutions[[https://oidp.net/en/practice.php?id=1410]].

- **Bottom-up and experimental engagement:** Danish cities, especially Copenhagen, have implemented **bottom-up engagement platforms** and experimental participatory methods. For example, the city’s online engagement initiative required proposals to have multiple co-submitters and a threshold of votes before official consideration, fostering collective action and broader participation[[https://www.govocal.com/case-studies/copenhagen-proposals-12000-residents-participate]]. Projects like Superkilen in Copenhagen involved residents from over 50 nationalities in co-designing public spaces, ensuring that urban improvements reflect the needs and identities of diverse communities[[https://crowdsourcingweek.com/blog/citizen-engagement-rewarded-copenhagen-greater-urban-mobility/]].

- **Smart city participation mechanisms:** In Danish smart city projects, citizen participation is enabled through mechanisms such as access to funding, support for civic organizations (*foreninger*), and transparent, open meeting procedures (*dagsorden*). These mechanisms empower citizens to take part in decision-making and co-create urban solutions, supporting both autonomy and sustained engagement[[https://forskning.ruc.dk/files/100481748/HCII_PDSmartCity_2023.pdf]].

- **Reaching underrepresented groups:** Danish planners have experimented with new forms of participation—such as courtyard meetings, online consultations, and social events—to engage citizens who are typically hard to reach, including those with limited Danish language skills or from minority backgrounds[[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07352166.2024.2323518]][[https://forskning.ruc.dk/files/64474135/Innovative_Forms_of_Citizen_Participation_at_the_Fringe_of_the_Formal_Planning_System.pdf]]. These approaches aim to make urban planning more inclusive and responsive to all residents.

- **Online and hybrid formats:** The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the use of online formats for public consultations, enabling broader participation and allowing citizens to submit questions and feedback virtually[[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07352166.2024.2323518]].

In summary, Denmark’s approach to the 'More citizens' topic is characterized by a **systematic, innovative, and inclusive model of citizen participation** in urban planning, with a strong emphasis on both formal and experimental methods to ensure that all voices are heard in shaping the future of Danish cities[[https://oidp.net/en/practice.php?id=1410]][[https://www.iied.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/migrate/G01293.pdf]][[https://www.govocal.com/case-studies/copenhagen-proposals-12000-residents-participate]][[https://forskning.ruc.dk/files/100481748/HCII_PDSmartCity_2023.pdf]][[https://crowdsourcingweek.com/blog/citizen-engagement-rewarded-copenhagen-greater-urban-mobility/]][[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07352166.2024.2323518]].",Denmark
Social funds project to get youth into jobs or education,"Denmark has implemented several **social funds and targeted projects to get youth into jobs or education**, with a strong focus on early intervention, activation, and tailored support for vulnerable groups. The most relevant and specific initiatives include:

- **European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) 2021–2027**: Denmark uses ESF+ funding to strengthen growth and development by increasing the number of young people with vocational or higher education, expanding the workforce by moving those marginally attached to the labor market closer to employment, and ensuring the social integration of at-risk youth, including preventing youth homelessness. The ESF+ supports targeted and flexible further education and aims to enhance workforce skills, with municipalities playing a key role in local implementation[[https://udviklingidanmark.erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/sites/default/files/2024-02/ESF_%202021-2027%20-%20Abridged%20version.%20version-a.pdf]].

- **Youth Guarantee Scheme**: All young people under 25 are guaranteed a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship, or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education. This scheme is partnership-based, involving public authorities, social partners, education institutions, and guidance centers, and emphasizes early intervention and supportive measures for labor market integration[[https://www.oyed.org/index.php?aid=253-7]][[https://national-policies.eacea.ec.europa.eu/youthwiki/chapters/denmark/36-integration-of-young-people-in-the-labour-market]][[https://employment-social-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies-and-activities/eu-employment-policies/youth-employment-support/reinforced-youth-guarantee/where-register-youth-guarantee_en]].

- **Active Labor Market Policies (ALMPs)**: Denmark requires unemployed youth to participate in ALMPs, which include frequent meetings with caseworkers, job search counseling, training, work practice, and employment with wage subsidies. These programs are intensified for uneducated youth, who receive weekly mentoring and are encouraged to enroll in preparatory adult education or vocational training. The aim is to improve both employment outcomes and educational attainment[[https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/effect-active-labor-market-policies-combat-youth-unemployment-denmark]][[https://national-policies.eacea.ec.europa.eu/youthwiki/chapters/denmark/36-integration-of-young-people-in-the-labour-market]].

- **Municipal Youth Measures (Kommunal Ungeindsats)**: Municipalities are responsible for early intervention, mandatory activation, and tailored activation plans for both insured and uninsured young people. Unskilled and vulnerable youth are guided toward vocational training, internships, wage-subsidy jobs, and socially useful tasks. The 2013 cash benefits reform introduced individualized activation pathways for those under 30, with education benefits at the same level as state educational grants for those without vocational education[[https://national-policies.eacea.ec.europa.eu/youthwiki/chapters/denmark/36-integration-of-young-people-in-the-labour-market]].

- **Vocational Education and Training (VET) and EGU Programs**: Denmark offers various vocational pathways, including the EGU (basic vocational education and training) for youth under 30 who are not in education or employment. These programs combine practical training with school-based learning and are tailored to individual needs, aiming to provide both employment and educational competencies[[https://eurydice.eacea.ec.europa.eu/eurypedia/denmark/teaching-and-learning-vocational-upper-secondary-education]][[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_secondary_education_in_Denmark]].

- **Individual Placement and Support (IPS) for Youth with Mental Health Challenges**: From 2023–2026, Denmark is piloting IPS measures to help young people with psychiatric disorders access jobs or education, integrating mental health, education, and employment services[[https://national-policies.eacea.ec.europa.eu/youthwiki/chapters/denmark/36-integration-of-young-people-in-the-labour-market]][[https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/investing-in-youth-north-denmark-region_0856ce12-en.html]].

- **Recent Regulatory Changes (2025)**: New rules effective July 2025 expand permissible working hours for youth aged 15–17 who have completed compulsory education, making it easier for them to participate in part-time and summer jobs, thus supporting early work experience and smoother transitions into the labor market[[https://nnroad.com/policy-update/denmarks-youth-employment-regulations-2025-support-for-youth-and-employers/]].

These initiatives are supported by **online resources** from Danish government agencies, the European Social Fund, and international organizations such as the OECD, which provide further details and evaluations of these programs[[https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/effect-active-labor-market-policies-combat-youth-unemployment-denmark]][[https://www.oyed.org/index.php?aid=253-7]][[https://national-policies.eacea.ec.europa.eu/youthwiki/chapters/denmark/36-integration-of-young-people-in-the-labour-market]][[https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/investing-in-youth-north-denmark-region_0856ce12-en.html]][[https://udviklingidanmark.erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/sites/default/files/2024-02/ESF_%202021-2027%20-%20Abridged%20version.%20version-a.pdf]][[https://employment-social-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies-and-activities/eu-employment-policies/youth-employment-support/reinforced-youth-guarantee/where-register-youth-guarantee_en]].

Key features specific to Denmark include:
- **Mandatory and early activation** for all unemployed youth.
- **Municipal responsibility** for individualized support and integration.

Preservation of landscape,"Denmark has a highly developed and distinctive approach to **preservation of landscape**, rooted in national legislation, strategic mapping, and a strong tradition of integrating nature protection with land-use planning.

Key aspects specific to Denmark include:

- **Nature Protection Act (Naturbeskyttelsesloven):** This is the cornerstone of Danish landscape preservation, aiming to protect nature, species, habitats, and cultural values while ensuring public access to nature. About 10% of Denmark’s land is protected under this act, covering lakes, bogs, meadows, and salt marshes[[https://biodiversity.europa.eu/countries/denmark/green-infrastructure]][[https://en.lbst.dk/nature-and-forestry/nature/national-nature-protection]][[https://www.legal500.com/guides/chapter/denmark-environment/?export-pdf]].

- **Preservation (“fredning”):** Denmark’s oldest and most comprehensive form of nature protection, dating back to 1917, allows for the permanent preservation of natural areas. This imposes significant restrictions on land use, and landowners may receive compensation, reflecting the seriousness of preservation in Danish law[[https://en.lbst.dk/nature-and-forestry/nature/national-nature-protection]].

- **Green Map of Denmark (Grønt Danmarkskort):** Introduced in 2015, this strategic and digital mapping initiative guides the preservation and development of interconnected natural habitats. Municipalities are required to designate and plan for valuable nature areas and ecological corridors, ensuring that preservation is coordinated at both local and national levels. The Green Map is gradually being implemented until 2050 and is supported by digital tools like the Nature Map (“naturkort”) and Biodiversity Map (“biodiversitetskort”)[[https://biodiversity.europa.eu/countries/denmark/green-infrastructure]][[https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/dk/dk-nbsap-v2-en.pdf]].

- **Natura 2000 Sites:** Denmark participates in the EU’s Natura 2000 network, with over 9% of its land and 18% of its marine area designated as protected sites for rare and endangered species. These areas are managed with specific action plans and are central to Denmark’s landscape preservation strategy[[https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/dk/dk-nbsap-v2-en.pdf]][[https://en.lbst.dk/nature-and-forestry/nature/national-nature-protection]].

- **Restoration and Rewilding Initiatives:** Recent policy shifts, such as the Tripartite Agreement, aim to restore large areas of low-lying farmland to natural habitats like wetlands and meadows. This not only preserves landscapes but also addresses biodiversity, climate adaptation, and flood mitigation. The goal is to restore up to 140,000 hectares of farmland, with projects involving detailed landscape and hydrology analysis[[https://scalgo.com/en-US/blog/rewilding-and-restoring-danish-landscapes]].

- **Integration with Climate and Environmental Policy:** Denmark’s landscape preservation efforts are closely linked to climate goals, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions by converting carbon-rich farmland to nature areas, and improving water management to prevent flooding and enhance biodiversity[[https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/dk/dk-nbsap-v2-en.pdf]][[https://scalgo.com/en-US/blog/rewilding-and-restoring-danish-landscapes]].

- **Municipal and Local Involvement:** Preservation is not only a national effort but also relies on local knowledge and support. Municipalities play a key role in designating and managing protected areas, often through voluntary agreements with landowners[[https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/dk/dk-nbsap-v2-en.pdf]].

- **Cultural Landscape Protection:** In addition to natural landscapes, Denmark protects cultural sites and monuments under the Danish Museum Act and other heritage laws, ensuring a holistic approach to landscape preservation that includes both natural and cultural values[[https://slks.dk/english/work-areas/cultural-heritage/sites-and-monuments/protected-sites-and-monuments]][[https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/dk/Laws]].

These policies and tools make Denmark’s approach to landscape preservation notable for its integration of legal protection, strategic mapping, restoration, and community involvement, all underpinned by a strong legislative framework and digital infrastructure[[https://biodiversity.europa.eu/countries/denmark/green-infrastructure]][[https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/dk/dk-nbsap-v2-en.pdf]][[https://scalgo.com/en-US/blog/rewilding-and-restoring-danish-landscapes]][[https://en.lbst.dk/nature-and-forestry/nature/national-nature-protection]].",Denmark
Tram,"Denmark has recently reintroduced and expanded **tram and light rail systems** in several cities, making trams a significant and current topic for urban planning in the country. The most notable projects are in **Copenhagen, Odense, and Aarhus**, each with distinct characteristics and urban impacts.

**Key Denmark-Specific Tram Developments:**

- **Greater Copenhagen Light Rail (Hovedstadens Letbane):**
  - A new 28 km light rail line with 29 stations is under construction, connecting Lyngby to Ishøj and serving major destinations like the Technical University of Denmark and several hospitals.
  - The system is designed for high frequency (every 5 minutes) and aims to enhance accessibility, support urban development, and attract private investment.
  - The southern section is expected to open in October 2025, with the northern section following in 2026[[https://www.idom.com/en/project/tramways-in-copenhagen-and-odense/]][[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Copenhagen_Light_Rail]].

- **Odense Letbane:**
  - Odense, Denmark’s third-largest city, opened its first modern tram/light rail line, running 14 km with 26 stations from Tarup to Hjallese.
  - The tramway is central to Odense’s urban strategy, aiming to handle growing commuter numbers, reduce congestion, and stimulate urban development along the route.
  - The project was split into multiple construction and procurement packages to increase competition and efficiency, and it is already attracting significant investment in the areas surrounding the line[[https://www.idom.com/en/project/tramways-in-copenhagen-and-odense/]][[https://technologymagazine.com/company-reports/odense-letbane-delivering-first-ever-light-rail-denmarks-third-city]].

- **Aarhus Letbane:**
  - Aarhus has implemented a **tram-train** concept, allowing vehicles to operate both as street trams in the city and as commuter trains on existing rail lines.
  - The project involved major infrastructure works, including new tunnels and bridges, and is seen as a model for integrating different transport modes in Denmark[[https://www.eib.org/en/stories/trams-gain-traction-in-denmark]].

**Urban and Planning Context:**
- These tram projects are closely tied to **urban development strategies** in Denmark, with trams seen as catalysts for growth, densification, and sustainable mobility.
- Danish planners emphasize integrating tramways with other modes (bicycles, buses, regional trains) and urban amenities, reflecting Denmark’s holistic approach to transport and land use[[https://www.idom.com/en/project/tramways-in-copenhagen-and-odense/]][[https://technologymagazine.com/company-reports/odense-letbane-delivering-first-ever-light-rail-denmarks-third-city]][[https://centreforpublicimpact.org/public-impact-fundamentals/land-use-and-transport-in-denmark/]].
- The reintroduction of trams is relatively recent, as most Danish cities dismantled their original tram systems in the mid-20th century. The new systems are modern, accessible, and designed to support Denmark’s climate and urbanization goals[[https://www.tramguide.com/trams-in-denmark/]].

**Lessons and Innovations:**
- Danish tram projects use advanced digital tools (like BIM) for design and construction, and sustainability is a core focus, with efforts to minimize environmental impact and maximize urban value[[https://www.idom.com/en/project/tramways-in-copenhagen-and-odense/]][[https://www.autodesk.com/blogs/construction/how-copenhagen-metro-is-building-a-more-sustainable-future/]].
- The Odense project, in particular, highlights the importance of treating tramways as strategic urban infrastructure, not just transport solutions, to unlock broader economic and social benefits[[https://technologymagazine.com/company-reports/odense-letbane-delivering-first-ever-light-rail-denmarks-third-city]].

**Summary Table: Major Tram Projects in Denmark**

Car fleet transormation to EV,"Denmark is experiencing one of the fastest and most significant transformations of its car fleet to electric vehicles (EVs) in Europe, with several features specific to its context:

- **Market Share and Growth:** In the first half of 2025, nearly 64% of all newly registered cars in Denmark were electric, and among private buyers, the figure was almost 82%—the highest ever recorded for the country[[https://www.electrive.com/2025/07/04/denmark-over-80-of-new-private-cars-were-electric-in-h1-2025/]][[https://eleport.com/ev-sales-in-europe-2025-the-first-half/]]. This represents a dramatic increase from 45% market share in early 2024, making Denmark the European country with the largest year-on-year jump in EV market share in 2025[[https://eleport.com/ev-sales-in-europe-2025-the-first-half/]].

- **Policy and Incentives:** Denmark’s rapid EV adoption has been driven by significant government incentives, such as tax deductions on EV investments and battery tax exemptions. However, these incentives are being phased out as the market matures. The battery tax exemption will end in 2025, and registration taxes on EVs will be reintroduced from 2026, with full implementation by 2035[[https://evtcp.org/country/denmark/]].

- **Climate Goals and Regulation:** The Danish government is aligning with EU regulations that require all new passenger vehicle sales to be zero-emission by 2035. As of 2025, about 12% of the total car fleet in Denmark is electric, and this share is expected to rise steadily as older gasoline and diesel vehicles are replaced[[https://evtcp.org/country/denmark/]].

- **Consumer Preferences:** Danish consumers are increasingly motivated by environmental concerns, seeking to reduce their carbon footprint and air pollution. This has contributed to the strong preference for EVs, especially among private buyers[[https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/denmark]].

- **Popular Models:** The best-selling EVs in Denmark in 2025 include the Skoda Elroq, Volkswagen ID.4, and Tesla Model Y, reflecting a strong market for battery-electric vehicles[[https://www.electrive.com/2025/07/04/denmark-over-80-of-new-private-cars-were-electric-in-h1-2025/]].

- **Future Outlook:** With incentives being phased out and taxes reintroduced, there is ongoing discussion about creating a simpler, more permanent car taxation model to support the green transition and maintain momentum toward decarbonization[[https://www.electrive.com/2025/07/04/denmark-over-80-of-new-private-cars-were-electric-in-h1-2025/]][[https://evtcp.org/country/denmark/]].

These trends and policies are specific to Denmark’s context and illustrate how the country is rapidly transforming its car fleet to electric vehicles, setting an example for other European nations.",Denmark
Getting young into education or work,"Denmark is actively addressing the challenge of getting young people into education or work through recent policy reforms, targeted initiatives, and a strong focus on vocational training.

- **Recent Youth Employment Reforms (2025):** As of July 2025, Denmark introduced new regulations to make it easier for youth aged 15–17 who have completed compulsory education to participate in part-time and summer employment. These reforms expand permissible working hours and adjust school-leaving timing, aiming to provide more flexible opportunities for young people to gain work experience and support employers during peak seasons[[https://nnroad.com/policy-update/denmarks-youth-employment-regulations-2025-support-for-youth-and-employers/]].

- **Vocational Education and Training (VET) Focus:** 2025 has been declared the ""Year of Vocational Education and Training"" in Denmark, with significant government and cross-sector investment to promote VET pathways. The government is raising awareness of the over 100 vocational programs available, highlighting good salaries, meaningful jobs, and entrepreneurial opportunities. Major events like EuroSkills 2025 are being used to inspire and inform young people about these options[[https://www.da.dk/en/politics-and-analysis/2025/denmark-raises-the-flag-for-vocational-education-and-training/]].

- **Youth Employment and Unemployment Rates:** 
    - The youth unemployment rate (ages 15–24) was 10.1% at the end of 2024, slightly above the long-term average but lower than some previous years[[https://tradingeconomics.com/denmark/youth-unemployment-ratio-15-24-eurostat-data.html]][[https://ycharts.com/indicators/denmark_youth_unemployment_rate_lfs]].
    - The employment rate for the 20–29 age group was 74.1% in December 2024, indicating a relatively high level of youth engagement in the labor market[[https://tradingeconomics.com/denmark/youth-employment-rate-age-group-20-29-eurostat-data.html]].
    - However, nearly 45,000 young people aged 15–24 are not in jobs or education, with significant regional variation across Denmark’s municipalities[[https://cphpost.dk/2025-09-15/news/round-up/more-young-people-are-without-jobs-and-education-in-68-municipalities/]].

- **Education and Employment Link:** 
    - Young adults without upper secondary education face higher unemployment (11.5%) compared to those with upper secondary (6.3%) or tertiary qualifications[[https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/education-at-a-glance-2025_1a3543e2-en/denmark_4ec12dea-en.html]][[https://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=DNK&treshold=10&topic=EO]].
    - The employment rate for 25–34-year-olds without upper secondary education is 55%, compared to 79% for those with at least upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education[[https://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=DNK&treshold=10&topic=EO]].
    - Denmark’s NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) rate for young people increased from 10.5% to 11.6% between 2016 and 2023, despite a decrease in the OECD average[[https://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=DNK&treshold=10&topic=EO]].

- **Gender and Social Mobility:** 
    - Women in Denmark are more likely than men to have tertiary qualifications, but employment rates for young women with lower educational attainment lag behind those of men[[https://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=DNK&treshold=10&topic=EO]].
    - Social mobility remains a challenge: only 23% of adults whose parents lack upper secondary education attain tertiary qualifications themselves[[https://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=DNK&treshold=10&topic=EO]].

These efforts reflect Denmark’s multi-pronged approach: regulatory changes to facilitate youth employment, a national campaign to boost vocational education, and ongoing monitoring of youth labor market outcomes. The focus is on both increasing opportunities for work experience and addressing educational attainment gaps to ensure more young people transition successfully into employment or further education[[https://nnroad.com/policy-update/denmarks-youth-employment-regulations-2025-support-for-youth-and-employers/]][[https://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=DNK&treshold=10&topic=EO]][[https://www.da.dk/en/politics-and-analysis/2025/denmark-raises-the-flag-for-vocational-education-and-training/]][[https://cphpost.dk/2025-09-15/news/round-up/more-young-people-are-without-jobs-and-education-in-68-municipalities/]].",Denmark
Electrical construction machines,"Based on the search results provided, there is **limited specific information about electrical construction machines** in the context of Denmark's regulatory framework. However, I can share what is relevant:

## Regulatory Framework for Technical Equipment

Denmark has established comprehensive regulations for technical equipment through the **Executive Order on the Design of Technical Equipment** (No. 429 of 5 April 2022) and the **Executive Order on the Application of Technical Equipment** (No. 428 of 5 April 2022)[[http://at.dk/en/regulations/executive-orders/executive-order-on-the-application-of-technical-equipment/]][[https://at.dk/en/regulations/executive-orders/executive-order-on-the-design-of-technical-equipment/]]. These orders cover the design, labeling, instructions for use, testing, and placing on the market of technical equipment.

**Key requirements for technical equipment in Denmark include:**

Technical equipment must be designed to be fully justifiable from a health and safety perspective and usable without threatening health and safety when used as intended[[https://at.dk/en/regulations/executive-orders/executive-order-on-the-design-of-technical-equipment/]]. Equipment must be constructed of suitable materials, taking into account foreseeable stresses, with necessary strength and durability to address health and safety issues[[https://at.dk/en/regulations/executive-orders/executive-order-on-the-design-of-technical-equipment/]].

## Design Responsibilities

Those responsible for designing new technical equipment or modifying existing equipment must assess the risks and hazards associated with intended use and reasonably predictable misuse[[https://at.dk/en/regulations/executive-orders/executive-order-on-the-design-of-technical-equipment/]]. They must also evaluate whether modifications to existing equipment are significant enough to trigger other regulations, such as CE marking requirements[[https://at.dk/en/regulations/executive-orders/executive-order-on-the-design-of-technical-equipment/]].

## Exemptions

Notably, machinery and equipment covered by EU harmonization legislation (total harmonization) are excluded from these Danish executive orders, as are construction components covered by harmonization legislation of the European Parliament and Council[[https://at.dk/en/regulations/executive-orders/executive-order-on-the-design-of-technical-equipment/]].

However, **THERE'S NOTHING SPECIFIC** about ""electrical construction machines"" as a distinct category with dedicated Danish regulations in the search results provided. The information available covers general technical equipment and electrical installations broadly, but does not address construction machines specifically in the electrical context.",Denmark
Policy for architecture,"Denmark’s **Policy for Architecture** is a nationally coordinated framework that guides the development of the built environment, emphasizing sustainability, social inclusion, and quality of life. It is not a set of binding laws, but rather a collection of ambitions and recommendations that influence legislation, planning, and practice across the country[[https://dac.dk/en/magazine/what-is-an-architecture-policy-and-why-is-it-important-to-you]][[https://arkitekturogdesign.com/en/blogs/artikler-1/nyhed-ny-dansk-arkitekturpolitik]][[https://dac.dk/en/how-will-we-live-in-2050]].

Nobody should be left alone (leisure),"The concept of ensuring that nobody is left alone in leisure activities has been a significant focus in Denmark, particularly through the implementation of the **fritidspas** (leisure card) system and related initiatives aimed at combating social exclusion among children and young people.

## The Fritidspas System

Denmark's leisure card initiative is primarily directed towards children and young people from socially vulnerable families and is available in approximately 80 percent of Danish municipalities[[https://www.mesaatio.fi/articles/finland-denmark-and-sweden-offer-leisure-cards-to-fight-social-exclusion-in-children-and-adolescents]]. As of 2019, two out of three municipalities offered discounts through the fritidspas for leisure activities[[https://national-policies.eacea.ec.europa.eu/youthwiki/chapters/denmark/89-enhancing-social-inclusion-through-culture]]. The card helps cover participation fees for various recreational activities, addressing financial barriers that prevent children from engaging in sports, cultural activities, and other hobbies.

## Beyond Financial Support: The Roskilde Approach

The municipality of Roskilde has developed an innovative model that recognizes financial subsidies alone are insufficient to ensure genuine inclusion. With approximately 50,000 inhabitants, Roskilde allocates around 250,000 Danish kroner (€33,000) annually for the leisure card itself, but more significantly, dedicates one million Danish kroner (€135,000) to building **partnerships with sports clubs**[[https://www.mesaatio.fi/articles/finland-denmark-and-sweden-offer-leisure-cards-to-fight-social-exclusion-in-children-and-adolescents]].

These partnerships provide sports clubs with part-time employees whose primary responsibility is supporting children and adolescents who would otherwise be unable to participate due to family circumstances or finances. These employees serve as crucial links between children and coaches, ensuring young people from vulnerable families are genuinely included in group activities[[https://www.mesaatio.fi/articles/finland-denmark-and-sweden-offer-leisure-cards-to-fight-social-exclusion-in-children-and-adolescents]]. The municipality also provides guidance to clubs on welcoming new members, emphasizing that a good start plays a crucial role in children's commitment to activities.

## Government Support for Vulnerable Youth

In April 2020, the Danish government and all parliamentary parties reached an agreement allocating DKK 131 million to support socially marginalized people, with measures specifically targeting children and young people. This included DKK 10 million for voluntary organizations, cultural institutions, sports associations, and scouts associations to support outreach measures for vulnerable children, including learning activities, leisure passes, summer camps, and family friends programs[[https://national-policies.eacea.ec.europa.eu/youthwiki/chapters/denmark/89-enhancing-social-inclusion-through-culture]].

Additionally, DKK 22.3 million was allocated between 2020-2023 to broaden the fritidspas measure to include marginalized children and young people in after-school and leisure activities[[https://national-policies.eacea.ec.europa.eu/youthwiki/chapters/denmark/89-enhancing-social-inclusion-through-culture]].

## Recent Cultural Integration Initiatives

In May 2025, seven municipalities on the island of Funen received 7 million DKK (approximately €940,000) from the Danish Agency for Culture and Palaces for the project **Fynsk KulturRum**, part of the national Culture Pass Initiative. This program uses culture, sports, and community activities to improve mental well-being, social integration, employment, or education outcomes for vulnerable youth aged 15-24 who are outside the education system and labor market[[https://interreg-baltic.eu/project-posts/arts-on-prescription/new-danish-initiative-builds-on-arts-on-prescription-to-support-vulnerable-youth/]]. The project aims to enhance young people's engagement in culture and leisure communities, build confidence, improve mental health, and help participants gain skills such as responsibility, teamwork, and routine-building.

## The Role of Voluntary Associations

Voluntary associations, particularly within sport and scouting, are considered key players in social inclusion through leisure in Denmark. These organizations receive economic support from both the state and municipalities and play an important role in establishing norms, creating social skills and networks, and enhancing the inclusion of young people into Danish society[[https://national-policies.eacea.ec.europa.eu/youthwiki/chapters/denmark/89-enhancing-social-inclusion-through-culture]]. Sport and leisure are specifically viewed as **""deep integration tools""** for refugees and other vulnerable groups in Denmark[[https://www.isca.org/news-detail/828/we-see-sport-and-leisure-as-a-deep-integration-tool-for-refugees-in-denmark-new-podcast]].

The Danish approach emphasizes that preventing social exclusion through leisure requires not just financial accessibility, but also active engagement strategies, community partnerships, and supportive social infrastructure to ensure meaningful participation and belonging.",Denmark
